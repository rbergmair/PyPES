	<t doc="GH951020-000060">Speaking at yesterday's forum in Glasgow City Chambers Mike Finlayson, chief executive of EOS, said: ''The concept of employee ownership in Scotland is becoming more and more attractive as a new business opportunity. ''This is perhaps most dramatically demonstrated in rescue bids where employees invest in their own future by securing ownership of companies threatened with closure. ''There is no doubt that employee ownership can help stimulate birth rate, enourage business growth, and guarantee the continuation of family-owned businesses for future generations. ''Scotland can learn a great deal about employee ownership from America where there are over 10,000 employee owned companies, and from Japan where over 90% of companies have a significant level of employee ownership.'' But Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Council Development and Industry, gave a word of caution and said: ''A desire to preserve your own job is powerful and noble but it is not enough. ''Success is only likely where the workforce take over a going concern or where like-minded individuals come together to create a new business. ''In either event, there must be a unifying commitment by all employees to the business and its customers.'' He added: ''Employee Ownership Scotland must equip itself to advise and support groups of employees presented with such opportunities.''. </t>

	<t doc="GH950501-000106">Announcing the establishment of Scottish Caspian Trade (SCT) on the eve of the Houston oil get-together OTC 95, Kourosh Bassiti, head of Scottish Enterprise National's (SEN) Energy Group, said: ''Part of our international remit is to identify emerging target markets, evaluate the technological or product requirements in that particular area and match those requirements against Scotland's manufacturing, service and supply base. ''Azerbaijan has been selected because the hydrocarbon extraction requirements and problems are very similar to those encountered in the North Sea, thus making the market opportunities relatively easy to understand for our companies. ''In our view, high-technology companies and technology-led product suppliers from Scotland will experience less resistance than they encounter in other parts of the former Soviet Union, particularly those areas involved in offshore operations.'' Mr Bassiti said the Caspian development would also have to use these technologies to develop their offshore oil and gas fields efficiently and economically. ''Behind the political and economic uncertainties that presently beset Azerbaijan we believe there lies tremendous opportunities to become part of one of the greatest industrial and economic changes of this century. ''Western expertise and knowledge in all aspects of oil services and supply are in great demand. ''Much of the required technology and skills developed during the opening up of the North Sea are not emerging as rapidly as expected in Azerbaijan. ''This leaves a vast area of untapped opportunity where Scottish oil service and supply companies can comfortably provide leading edge technology ahead of their foreign competitors. ''Baku is unique among the former Soviet republics in that Azerbaijan's entire oil and gas exploration, development and production is centred in and immediately around the city. ''Unlike Western or Eastern Siberia, the Volga-Urals and Kazakhstan, where hydrocarbon deposits are spread over thousands of miles, the bulk of these deposits in Azerbaijan are contained within several hundred miles of Baku. ''From an offshore logistics perspective, access to the end-user is therefore relatively easy compared with Siberia, consequently giving greater investment return to companies who base themselves in Baku.'' The role of the new non-profit making company will be to provide administrative, service and support functions to the Scottish-based oil and gas service and supply companies who become members. </t>
