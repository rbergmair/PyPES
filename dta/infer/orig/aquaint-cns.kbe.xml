    How would Egypt respond to a biological weapons attack? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    17 February 1972 At the Arab Socialist Union National Congress, when asked to comment on Egyptian response to a possible Israeli BW attack, President Anwar Sadat stated, &quot;The only reply to biological warfare is that we too should use biological warfare. I believe that the density of the Israeli population confined in a small area would provide the opportunity to reply with the same weapon if they should begin using it. Briefly, we have the instruments of biological warfare in the refrigerators and we will not use them unless they begin to use them.&quot;

    The Israelis point to comments made by former President Anwar Sadat, who in 1970 stated that Egypt has biological weapons stored in refrigerators ready to use against Israel if need be. The program might include &quot;plague, botulism toxin, encephalitis virus, anthrax, Rift Valley fever and mycotoxicosis.&quot;

    Has Egypt traditionally sought to develop WMD capabilities? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Writing for Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst, reporter Al Venter notes that too few Middle East experts know that Egypt likely possesses a biological weapons program and vigorously pursues new unconventional systems. Recent comments by US Undersecretary of State John Bolton did not address Egypt's WMD programs, likely in deference to Egypt's important role in backing the United States in an anticipated invasion of Iraq. Egypt is strongly suspected of developing its own biowarfare facility.

Egyptian authorities have often claimed that Egypt would sign the CWC if Israel joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).[4] However, it must be noted that in 1990, Egypt and Iran were the only two Middle Eastern countries to participate in national trial inspections prior to the CWC's entry into force.[5] Although, under President Anwar al-Sadat in the 1970s, Egyptian officials talked about reciprocal retaliation to any attack, Egypt has never publicly maintained a first or second strike military doctrine with regards to CBW agents.

The Central Military Chemical Laboratories of the Egyptian Army researched sulphur and nitrogen mustard blister agents, organophosphorous nerve agents such as sarin and VX-related compounds.[8] Other laboratories conducting related research with Egyptian affiliates included the Egyptian National Research Center, Ain-Shams University, and the Technical University of Budapest, Hungary. During the time frame of the mid-to-late 1970s, Egypt also conducted significant research on psychotomimetic glycolates such as BZ and EA-3443.[9] In the 1980s, scientists at the National Research Center in Cairo studied organophosphates, including nerve-agent-like pesticides and the effects of seawater on organophosphates, perhaps to study the effects of sea dumping older CW inventories.

In 1989, US and Swiss officials stated that the Swiss company Krebs A.G. delivered parts to Egypt to be installed in a plant &quot;intended to make poison gas&quot; at Abu Za'abal, 25 miles north of Cairo. A Swiss foreign ministry official, however, stated that there is &quot;reason to believe&quot; Egypt has intentions to produce chemical weapons, which might include the nerve agent sarin. The Swiss government did, however, take action after Egypt refused to provide assurances that the plant would be used for civilian purposes, prompting a demand that Krebs sever its relationship with the project.

    Krebs is a reputed Swiss chemical company that works with a several foreign countries in research that in a host of subjects related to chemical processes. Whether it knowingly assisted Egypt in developing a covert CW capability is speculative. According to a New York Times report, Krebs had also provided equipment to build a chemical plant for the Egyptian El Nasr Pharmaceutical Company to make phosphorous trichloride, a chemical found in pesticides and the export of which is controlled. Designs for the chemical plant were purchased by Krebs from Stauffer Chemicals, a US enterprise.[15] This particular Krebs incident is somewhat ambiguous. Although credible news sources reported about the shipment and US officials acknowledged the incident, it has never been explicitly stated what exactly was the &quot;equipment&quot; involved. The New York Times is the only source that mentions the El Nasr-Krebs-Stauffer connection, and the information surrounding these allegations appear to be based on intelligence sources that were never made publicly available.

Upon further investigation, it was discovered that Krebs?a chemical engineering company?continues to retain ties to foreign enterprises, including several in Egypt. Their cooperation with El Nasr and Abu Za'abal deals primarily with cholorinization-related work.[16] However, it must be noted that this information came directly from Krebs, which may not find it in its best interest to report of any illicit complicity to help build Egypt's CW program.

  <passage>
    Egypt's defense industry is largely split between two groups. First, is the National Organization for Military Production (NOMP), which is run by the Ministry for Defense Production. NOMP operates under the Ministry of Military Production, possibly a division of the Ministry for Defense Production.[17] In the early 1980s, the commercial names were changed to indicate general location and goods produced. The NOMP oversees 16 factories that fall under four groups: chemical industries, engineering industries, mining industries, and electronic industries.[18]

    What is the Arab Organization for Industrialization? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Some of Egypt's defense production also falls under the umbrella of the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI), based in Cairo. This collaborative entity was formed in 1975 by the governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The AOI operates as an independent entity exempt from Egyptian taxes, and its primary mandate was to form a mutual defense collaboration between the governments of the founding countries. Before the AOI could establish itself as a strong player in the defense community, it suffered strong setbacks when Egypt lost the support of several Arab governments for initiating peace talks with Israel. It regained some of its military contacts by the late 1980s but is believed to be primarily run by Egypt.[19]

    For instance, if allegations that Egypt already had certain CW agents before the Yom Kippur War of 1973, why did it refrain from using them? Some analysts believe that the Egyptians feared a nuclear retaliation from Israel, whereas others maintain that Egyptian CW capability, at the time, was exaggerated. Today, the Egyptian military is believed to be very well trained in chemical defense exercises and has conducted war games in the past that included the threat of CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and chemical) agents.

    It is worth noting again that the Egyptian Army is fully trained in CW defenses and has conducted military exercises simulating a CW attack. Given their use of CW agents in Yemen during the 1960s, it can be deduced that Egypt has familiarity with this weapon type. However, the extent to which it is producing chemical agents in an offensive manner remains to be determined.

    Most allegations point toward comments made by then-president Anwar Sadat in February 1972, stating Egypt possessed some BW capability. The comments were never published widely outside Egypt and two months later, in April 1972, Egypt signed the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). It has yet to ratify the treaty. Israeli nuclear capability and the fact that Israel has not signed the BWC are possible explanations offered for the lack of an Egyptian ratification.

Furthermore, Middle East Defense News states, &quot;Egypt has a program of military-applied research in the sphere of biological weapons, but no data has been obtained on the creation of biological agents in the interests of military offensive program

    What Egyptian facilities are suspected of producing CBW? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The El-Nasr Company for Medicinals and Antibiotics is the only name identified in most open sources as being connected to an alleged Egyptian BW program. Other universities and facilities profiled in this section do not prove a direct link to any BW activities, but they serve to demonstrate an understanding of the current scientific capabilities in Egypt. As pharmaceuticals and biotechnology-related facilities are believed to be used as legitimate &quot;covers&quot; for illicit activities, some institutions demonstrating Egyptian capabilities are reviewed. Furthermore, the dual-nature resources (scientific knowledge, equipment, cultures used) involved in pharmaceutical/biotechnology research and BW activities are often noted by experts. However, it must be strongly reiterated that these facilities do not prove any direct linkages to a military program but demonstrate the scientific capability Egypt currently possess. If Egypt indeed does have a covert BW program, it is well hidden behind a maze of legitimate institutions conducting work on pharmaceuticals, academic research, and health services.

    It is reasonable to assume that when Egypt made the decision to attack Israel in the Yom Kippur War, Cairo viewed CBW as key components of its military strategy, particularly in the absence of a nuclear capability. Thus, a considerable build-up of these weapons preceded the 1973 war.

    What were the most likely chemical weapons products produced by Egypt in the 1970s? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    During the 1970s, based on this accumulating technical knowledge, Military Plant No. 801 manufactured new CW agents to expand and improve Egypt's chemical arsenal.16 It appears likely that the first nerve agent produced was sarin. At a later stage, Egypt began manufacturing the persistent nerve agent VX and a military hallucinogen in the glycolate family.

    Why did Egypt reorganize its chemical industry? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Although the reorganization of the Egyptian chemical industry appeared to be entirely civilian in character, it was actually intended to improve Egypt's CW production capabilities. Strong evidence for this conclusion can be found in the doctoral dissertation submitted in 1985 by the head of Egypt's Chemical Warfare Directorate, General Mamdouh Hamed Ateya. His dissertation dealt with the future of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, and one of its central themes was that CW could constitute an important deterrent for the 1980s and beyond

    What progress has Egypt made in developing biological weapons? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Research and development efforts on a few of these agents are discussed below. Botulinum toxin.Various strains of the toxigenic bacterium Clostridium botulinum type B have been successfully cultivated (e.g., in infusion broth medium) and used for toxin production.95 This research took place even though there was no recorded incidence of botulism in Egypt until 1991, when a major outbreak sickened 91 hospital patients in Cairo, 20 percent of whom died.96 Industrial production of some closely related toxins, such as tetanus toxin and various veterinary Clostridial toxins, has been operational for several years, and was modernized in the late 1970s by the Public Health Institute of Bilthoven in the Netherlands.97 Plague. The causative bacterium of plague has been cultivated industrially in Egypt for vaccine production.98 Indigenous outbreaks of this disease have occurred,99 and the causative strains have presumably been isolated and studied. Egyptian scientists have also participated in research on plague conducted by the U.S. Navy Medical Research Unit (NAMRU-3) in Cairo, and at Walter Reed Army Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.100 Egyptian studies have included experimentation with a closely related pathogen, Pasteurella multocida, with a focus on environmental survivability and intranasal infection, presumably as a model pathogen for plague and tularemia.101 Anthrax. Although no scientific work has been published in Egypt on this classic BW agent, it is indigenous to the country. The closely related species Bacillus subtilis has been cultivated in industrial quantities at the El-Nasr pharmaceutical plant for the production of an enzyme.102 Another closely related species, Bacillus brevis, was used as a model bacterium for a continuousfermentation system in a study at the University of Kent, England, conducted by an Egyptian scientist affiliated with the Egyptian Military Technical College.103 Mycotoxins. In work supported in part by the U.S. Army, Egyptian researchers have extensively studied trichothecene mycotoxins, a class of potent toxins produced by the fungal mold Fusarium, including T-2 toxin, vomitoxin, and fusariotoxin.104 Since the 1960s, a closely related fungal mold (Gibberella fujikuori) was routinely used at the El-Nasr pharmaceutical plant for industrial fermentation.105 It has also been alleged that the Egyptian Air Force employed trichothecene mycotoxins as a biochemical weapon during the Yemen civil war.106

    According to Middle East analyst Anthony Cordesman, the United States seems to have no evidence of an active biological weapons program in Egypt. Egypt did sign the BWC in 1972 but has not ratified it. He claims that the United States believes that Egypt possessed biological weapons in 1972 and has not provided evidence of their disposal, suggesting the material might still be active. However, Cordesman writes that Israeli reports indicate different findings in support of an active program. The Israelis point to comments made by former President Anwar Sadat, who in 1970 stated that Egypt has biological weapons stored in refrigerators ready to use against Israel if need be. The program might include &quot;plague, botulism toxin, encephalitis virus, anthrax, Rift Valley fever and mycotoxicosis.&quot;

    In 1989, the military correspondent of the Egyptian newspaper Al Gumhuriya noted that Egypt and Iraq had agreed to conduct joint projects, the first of which was to assist Iraq in producing defensive measures against CBW.114 The Egyptian Minister of Military Industries vigorously denied that Egypt was in any way cooperating with Iraq to produce CBW or ballistic missiles.115 Nevertheless, the ambiguity between defensive and offensive research and development on BW is well-known, and the documented cooperation between Egypt and Iraq in the CW field may have extended to BW as well.

  <passage>
    North Korea probably has enough weapons-grade plutonium to produce at least two nuclear weapons. Additionally, North Korea has tested high explosives that might be used in triggering the fission reaction in a nuclear weapon. However, since North Korea has not tested a nuclear explosive device, it is uncertain whether the DPRK has actually developed nuclear weapons. Recently, reports have raised the possibility that Pakistan has assisted North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Notably, a June 2002 CIA report allegedly states that &quot;Pakistan also provided data on how to build and test a uranium-triggered nuclear weapon.&quot;[1] In addition, the same source reported that &quot;Since 1997, the CIA said, Pakistan had been sharing sophisticated technology, warhead-design information, and weapons-testing data with the Pyongyang regime.&quot;[2] If accurate, this report would suggest that North Korea has sufficient knowledge to make nuclear weapons and would not have to test to be assured that these weapons would function.

    How much Uranium does North Korea produce? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The number of nuclear weapons that North Korea may have depends on its level of technical sophistication, which may range from a high level requiring little fissile material to a much lower level of expertise requiring significantly greater quantities of HEU or plutonium. At the high end of technological sophistication, North Korea might be capable of using 3kg of weapons-grade plutonium or 10kg of weapons-grade uranium per weapon. Therefore, North Korea could currently produce two to three nuclear weapons with the 6 to 10kg of separated weapons-grade plutonium it is estimated to have. At the low end of weapons engineering sophistication, North Korea may need about 8kg of weapons-grade plutonium or 25kg of HEU per nuclear weapon, applying the IAEA quantities of concern. In that case, North Korea may only be able to produce at most one nuclear weapon with the up to 10kg of separated plutonium it may have. Finally, about 5kg or so of weapons-grade plutonium or about 16kg of HEU per bomb--amounts between the low and high ends of technological sophistication--are reasonable estimates of how much fissile material could be required for North Korea to produce a first-generation nuclear weapon, assuming the DPRK was able to make full use of available expertise, including possible assistance from other countries. In this scenario, North Korea may be able to produce up to two nuclear weapons with the up to 10kg of separated weapons-grade plutonium it may presently have.

  <question>
    Does North Korea have the ability to produce more sophisticated nuclear weapons, in particular, boosted or fission-fusion weapons? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    For North Korea to do this, a prerequisite would be to acquire sufficient amounts (at least grams worth) of tritium and deuterium, heavy forms of hydrogen, that fuse together inside such weapons. Although deuterium is relatively easy to acquire, for example from water, tritium is more difficult to produce because it is radioactive and has a relatively short half-life. Perhaps North Korea obtained supplies of tritium from Pakistan or some other supplier. However, there is no reliable open-source evidence for this acquisition or indigenous production of tritium. Therefore, the available evidence suggests that North Korea has not made sophisticated nuclear weapons. This conclusion is significant because it sets limits on North Korea's ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons. Such miniaturization may be necessary for the DPRK to be able to launch nuclear weapons over long distances using its current group of long-range ballistic missiles. If North Korea does not have either an indigenous or foreign source of tritium to enable miniaturization, it would have to turn to aircraft or some other non-missile delivery vehicle to use any nuclear weapons that it may possess, unless the payload of its ballistic missiles is on the order of hundreds of kilograms or more.

Ultimately, the General Department of Atomic Energy is beholden to Kim Jong Il and a small number of officials who hold senior positions in the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and the military. The Academy of Sciences manages most of the research institutions that could be described as "dual-use," and the National Defense Commission has ultimate authority over military applications of nuclear technology and materials.

    In May and June 1994, North Korean technicians, without the supervision of IAEA inspectors, once again discharged the reactor's spent fuel rods and placed them in the cooling pond. This action nearly led to a military confrontation with the United States, before former President Jimmy Carter's trip to Pyongyang defused the crisis. Carter's trip encouraged Kim Il Sung to accept some guidelines that resulted in the negotiation and conclusion of the Agreed Framework in October 1994. Under the terms of the agreement, the spent fuel rods that were unloaded in 1994 have now been canned and are stored in Yongbyon awaiting shipment to still undetermined third country. The agreement has also frozen this reactor, which is scheduled for dismantlement after the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) has completed the project to provide two light-water nuclear reactors at Shinp'o, South Hamgyong Province.

    Why did North Korea sign the NPT? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    In exchange for North Korea's signing the NPT in 1985, the USSR agreed to provide four light water nuclear reactors to be built at this site. The agreement, signed in December 1985, stipulated that Moscow would provide technical assistance in the construction of four VVER-440, each with a rating of 440MW(e), or a total of 1,760MW(e). The site in Shinpo had been selected by February 1990 and some preliminary site preparation was done before the USSR cancelled the project in 1991. Originally, the Soviet Union was scheduled to transfer the technical design of the VVER-440 reactor to North Korea by 1994. After the project was cancelled, North Korea decided to pursue indigenous development and design to construct three 635MW(e) light-water reactors at the site. This plan was cancelled once the KEDO light water reactor project began under the terms of the Agreed Framework. In March 1995, the Agreed Framework provided for the establishment of the KEDO consortium, which was created to supply North Korea with two 1,000MW(e) light water power reactors in exchange for Pyongyangs commitment to freeze its other nuclear facilities and nuclear weapons program and to permit the IAEA to verify the completeness and correctness of North Koreas initial declaration. Furthermore, the agreement stipulates that North Korea must uphold its safeguards commitments and remain a signatory to the NPT.

    When did India start its nuclear program? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    India's nuclear program was conceived in the pre-independence era by a small group of influential scientists who grasped the significance of nuclear energy and persuaded political leaders from the Indian National Congress to invest resources in the nuclear sector. In the aftermath of independence in August 1947, the Congress government led by Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru launched an ambitious dual-use, three-stage nuclear program to exploit India's abundant natural thorium reserves. The primary focus of the program was the production of inexpensive electricity. However, the decision to develop the complete nuclear fuel cycle--from ore mining, processing and fuel fabrication facilities, research and power reactors, spent-fuel reprocessing plants, heavy water production plants, and waste treatment and disposal facilities--also led to India's acquiring the technical capability to build nuclear weapons.

    What were the results of the nuclear tests in 1998? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Similar controversy dogs India's May 1998 tests. After the first of round of tests on May 11, India's Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) announced that it had tested three nuclear devices: a fission device with a yield of 12kt; a thermonuclear device with a yield of 43kt; and a sub-kiloton device with a yield of 0.2kt; The figures were later revised to 45kt for the thermonuclear device and 15kt for the fission device. However, these figures have been disputed by independent analysts, who--citing evidence from seismic data--claim that the cumulative yield of the Indian tests was more likely between 20-30kt, the implications being the thermonuclear test was likely to have been a failure. Senior Indian scientists such as P.K. Iyengar have also publicly suggested that it is likely that the fusion device only burned partially. However, the former head of India's Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Dr. R. Chidambaram has claimed that a &quot;post-shot&quot; analysis of the Pokhran II tests confirmed that the May 1998 tests yielded about 60kt. Chidambaram subsequently asserted that the tests provided India with &quot;the capability to design and fabricate nuclear weapons [in the range] of low-yields up to 200 kilotons.&quot;

    From where are the raw materials for nuclear tests obtained? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The plutonium for India's nuclear stockpile is most likely obtained from two research reactors: the 40MW CIRUS and 100MW Dhruva, which went critical in 1960 and 1985, respectively. The CIRUS reactor is capable of producing 9-10kg of weapons-grade plutonium annually; the corresponding figure for the Dhruva reactor is 20-25kg. The CIRUS reactor was shut down in 1997 for refurbishment and is expected to resume operations in 2003. Although the Dhruva went critical in 1985, vibration problems delayed normal operations until 1988. The irradiated fuel from the reactors is probably reprocessed at either the Plutonium Reprocessing Plant in Trombay (50 tons per year) or the Kalpakkam Reprocessing Plant at Kalpakkam (100-125 tons per year).

With these objectives in view, the Indian government has adopted a nuclear &quot;no-first-use&quot; or doctrine of &quot;retaliation only.&quot; The doctrine's central goal is to deter the threat of nuclear (subsequently revised to include chemical and biological) weapons use by any state or entity against India or its armed forces. In the event of deterrence failure, the doctrine states that India will resort to punitive strikes to inflict unacceptable losses on the adversary state or entity. However, India will not resort to the threat of use or use of nuclear weapons against states that do not possess nuclear (subsequently revised to include chemical and biological) weapons, or are not aligned with states that possess such capabilities.

By the early 1990s, when negotiations on the CTBT rapidly moved towards a resolution, Indian elites came to regard the CTBT not as an instrument of controlling the nuclear arms race, its original goal when it was first proposed, but rather as an instrument of nonproliferation that sought to freeze countries along the nuclear learning curve. The Indian government also objected to the treaty's entry-into-force provision, as well as clauses that allowed nuclear weapon states to conduct hydronuclear and hydrodynamic experiments to ensure the safety and reliability of their nuclear arsenals.

    What is believed about India's biological capabilities? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Although some intelligence estimates suggest that India possesses biological weapons, there is very limited open-source information available about a possible Indian biological weapon program. India has defensive biological weapon capabilities and has conducted research on countering various diseases, including plague, brucellosis, and smallpox. India also has an extensive and advanced pharmaceutical industry and is therefore technically capable of developing biological weapons. India ratified the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1974.

    After many years of denying the existence of a chemical weapon program, India disclosed in June 1997 that it possessed chemical weapons. Few details are publicly available concerning Indian chemical weapon stockpiles, although Chinese researchers suggest that India possesses 1,000 tons of chemical weapon agents, mostly mustard agent, located at five chemical weapon production and storage facilities. Under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which India signed in 1993 and ratified in September 1996, India must destroy 45 percent of its stockpile by 2004 and the remaining stockpile by 2007.

    What kind of missiles does India possess? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    For almost two decades, India has sought to develop and deploy ballistic and other missiles. User trials of the Prithvi-1 (150 km-range) and Prithvi-2 (250 km-range) ballistic missiles have been completed; both variants have been &quot;inducted&quot; into the Indian Army and Air Force respectively. India's Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) announced in September 2002 that the naval variant of the Prithvi (Dhanush) has completed sea trials and is ready for &quot;induction.&quot; Five tests of different versions of the intermediate-range Agni ballistic missile were conducted between May 1989 and January 2001. Limited series production of the Agni-TD-I (1,500 km-range) and Agni-II (2,000-2,500 km-range) has commenced, and the Indian Army is raising a missile group to take possession of the missiles. In January 2003, DRDO conducted a second test of the single-stage, solid-fuel, 700-800 km-range version of the Agni. This new missile has been dubbed the Agni-1; it will be the likely successor to the Prithvi-series, which will henceforth be used in a battlefield support role. India reportedly will test a 3,500-4,000 km-range variant of the Agni (Agni-III) by the end of 2003. 'Development flight-trials' of the supersonic cruise missile BrahMos/PJ-10, which India is co-developing with Russian assistance, are likely to continue through 2003, with serial production expected to begin in 2004. However, India's sea-launched ballistic missile, Sagarika, is not expected to become operational before 2010. India is not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR); in November 2002, it rejected a draft of the International Code of Conduct (ICOC) on ballistic missile proliferation on grounds that it is discriminatory and interferes with the peaceful uses of space technology.

    A high level of secrecy surrounds India's chemical weapons (CW) program, making it difficult to determine the exact number of chemical weapons facilities and organizations involved. India publicly acknowledged that it had a chemical warfare program after ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1997, but information on its CW stockpiles and production facilities remains strictly confidential. Under the CWC, India has declared three CW production facilities (CWPFs), two CW storage facilities (CWSFs), and two CW destruction facilities (CWDFs). India has also declared one Schedule 1 facility, four Schedule 2 facilities, 30 Schedule 3 facilities, and 19 discrete organic chemicals (DOC) facilities in its industry declaration.

The report indicates that India &quot;is making progress toward its aim of achieving self-sufficiency for its missile programs, but it continues to rely on foreign assistance.&quot; The report states that the Prithvi-1 short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) (150km range) continues to be the only deployed ballistic missile in India. The longer-range Prithvi-2 SRBM (250km) is also addressed as a modified version of the Prithvi-1. While the Agni ballistic missile will become the new mainstay for India's nuclear-armed missile arsenal this decade, the Sagarika sea-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) is estimated to enter service in 2010 or later.

    An Indian defense ministry official says that India's turbojet-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the Lakshya, will be subjected to missile-launch trials and other tests during the next two months in Israel. The Lakshya, which is a reusable UAV that can be launched from land or ship, is designed to operate at a maximum altitude of 30,000 feet. Representatives from the Aeronautical Development Establishment in Bangalore will oversee these trials. Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) officials say that the testing of the supersonic Lakshya in Israel is a step towards advanced Indo-Israeli cooperation in UAV production. The Israeli defense ministry, in addition to hosting these trials, has apparently agreed to pay for them as well. While these trials proceed, India will continue to pursue the development of a cruise missile UAV that is capable of carrying a 350kg payload over a range of 600km. Although numerous payloads have already been developed for the Lakshya, the Indian Air Force is apparently dissatisfied with the UAV and is calling for a replacement.

    India's 1,060kg meteorological satellite (METCAT) is successfully launched from Sriharikota on board a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). This is the first time that the Indian Space and Research Organization (ISRO) uses a PSLV to launch a meteorological satellite into a geo-synchronous transfer orbit (GTO). The METSAT, which was built by ISRO, &quot;carries a very high resolution radiometer (VHRR) capable of imaging earth in the visible, thermal infrared, and water vapor bands. Its data relay transponder can collect data from unattended meteorological platforms and relay it to the New Delhi Met Data utilization center.&quot; The PSLV has four stages that alternate between solid- and liquid-fuel sources. According to Indian media reports, &quot;the third stage solid propellant motor has been optimized and the liquid propellant in the fourth stage has been increased from two tons to two and a half tons.&quot; P.S. Goel, the Director of ISRO's satellite center, and Ramakrishnan, the Project Director of PSLV Missions, explain that the METSAT launch using the new PSLV series has &quot;given room for optimism that ISRO will be able to further optimize the various stages to raise a payload up to 1,200kg for a variety of uses.&quot; They remark that the PSLV may be able to send payloads into numerous orbits, including the low earth orbit, polar orbit, and GTO.

India is growing increasingly concerned because the United States, China, and Pakistan have yet to ratify the treaty, which is scheduled to go into effect on 29 April 1997.  ?Sanjeev Miglani, &quot;India Tries to Wiggle Out of Chemical Arms Treaty,&quot; Asia Times, 17 April 1997.

    What missile technologies does India employ? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    For almost two decades, India has sought to develop and deploy ballistic and other missiles. User trials of the Prithvi-1 (150 km-range) and Prithvi-2 (250 km-range) ballistic missiles have been completed; both variants have been &quot;inducted&quot; into the Indian Army and Air Force respectively. India's Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) announced in September 2002 that the naval variant of the Prithvi (Dhanush) has completed sea trials and is ready for &quot;induction.&quot; Five tests of different versions of the intermediate-range Agni ballistic missile were conducted between May 1989 and January 2001. Limited series production of the Agni-TD-I (1,500 km-range) and Agni-II (2,000-2,500 km-range) has commenced, and the Indian Army is raising a missile group to take possession of the missiles. In January 2003, DRDO conducted a second test of the single-stage, solid-fuel, 700-800 km-range version of the Agni. This new missile has been dubbed the Agni-1; it will be the likely successor to the Prithvi-series, which will henceforth be used in a battlefield support role. India reportedly will test a 3,500-4,000 km-range variant of the Agni (Agni-III) by the end of 2003. 'Development flight-trials' of the supersonic cruise missile BrahMos/PJ-10, which India is co-developing with Russian assistance, are likely to continue through 2003, with serial production expected to begin in 2004. However, India's sea-launched ballistic missile, Sagarika, is not expected to become operational before 2010.

    The United States has important security interests in South Asia, including preventing another Indo-Pakistani war and enhancing regional stability. Our nonproliferation goal is to persuade India and Pakistan to first cap, then reduce, and eventually eliminate their capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. This approach supports our global objective to reduce and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons. The consequences of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan would be catastrophic, both in terms of the loss of life and for potentially lowering the threshold for nuclear use in other parts of the world, particularly the adjacent Middle East/North Africa region.

    n April 1999, the Indian Army called for the formation of a National Infrastructure Cell to assess threats, implement and monitor countermeasures, and develop ways to rapidly warn potential targets of impending or ongoing attacks. The Army further asked for the establishment of a National Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, comprising scientists and government and private sector officials, to determine approaches to infrastructure defense and countermeasure formulation. In 2001, India increased the scope of its countermeasure capability through a recommendation by the State Government after the Indian Postal Department received 17 &quot;suspicious&quot; letters believed to contain Bacillus anthracis spores. A Bio-Safety Level 2 (BSL-2) Laboratory was established at the Institute of Preventive Medicine to provide guidance in preparing the Indian government for a biological attack. B. anthracis is one of many pathogens studied at the Institute, which also examines pathogens causing tuberculosis, typhoid, hepatitis B, rabies, yellow fever, Lassa fever, Ebola, and plague.

    What advances in biotechnology has India made over the past 20 years? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Biotechnology was limited in India until approximately 20 years ago, when the Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and a number of private entrepreneurs began to search for means to improve crop yields and seed production. India's need for increases in crop production was especially high, with a significant portion of the population unable to obtain suitable nourishment. India soon made great strides with wheat, pulses, and soy bean hybridization, and, as a result, food production in India increased from 50 million tons a year in 1950 to about 200 millions tons each year in the last several years. In fact, the rate of crop production has increased proportionally with the rate of population growth, and India has become self-sufficient in certain foods.  Many of these advances were facilitated using extensive knowledge of genetic engineering, which in turn provided information on the de novo synthesis of biological agents. Whether such synthesis has actually been done is uncertain. India has made substantial efforts to prepare its military force for a biological attack. In December 1998, India began to train its medical personnel to deal with the eventualities of such an attack. The director general of medical services at the time, Lt. Gen. R. Jayaswal, facilitated the Army Medical Corps? restructuring. This change incorporated a three-tiered training program for doctors and paramedical personnel

    Who officially oversees India's chemical weapons programs? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Control over India's CW program officially starts with the Government of India, which is responsible for ensuring the country's defense. Although the Office of the President is nominally in command of the armed forces, the executive responsibility for national defense and for the CW program rests with the Union Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. The next level down is the Raksha Mantri (Defence Minister). Within the Ministry of Defence, the CW program is overseen by the Department of Defence Research &amp; Development (DDR&amp;D), which is headed by a Secretary, who is also the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister. The main function of the DDR&amp;D is the formulation of research, design, and development plans for equipment used by the three military services. Reporting to the DDR&amp;D is the Defence Research &amp; Development Organization (DRDO), which administers the government laboratories working in the CW area.

A statement made by the Joint Secretary, External Publicity, of the Government of India states that the pesticide plants were put out to an international tender and companies from around the world competed for the tender. During this time no concerns were ever expressed by the international community. Also the statement continues by saying that India does not have chemical weapons and because of this, there is no way Indian companies have the technology, equipment, or expertise to aid Iran. Also India is an original signatory of the Chemical Weapons Convention and because of this has adopted a strict export licensing mechanism to control and monitor the exports of dual use chemicals.

  <question>
    How are India's efforts towards disarmament viewed by the rest of the world? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Given its unhesitating acceptance of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which aims to achieve the total elimination of chemical weapons, there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of its desire for complete nuclear disarmament.35 However, India has little to offer in between, for its own security or that of others, and little vision of what might lie in between and how it might manage the in-between. In particular, it has so far failed to develop a set of policies that blends collective security with the traditional threat of the use of force. One reason is that the nuclear nonproliferation regime, together with India's non-alignment, have placed obstacles in the way of adopting such an approach. Compared to France--which is involved in NATO and enjoys legitimized access to nuclear technology (due to its test of a nuclear device before January 1, 1967)--India has not been able to enjoy such benefits. As such, its task of finding a middle course is much more difficult.

    India's capability to produce chemical weapons is greatly enhanced by the sophistication of its domestic chemical industry. A number of government-owned and private sector companies produce an array of dual-use chemicals that are potential chemical weapons precursors and intermediates. A number of the domestically produced chemicals can be found on the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) lists of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 chemicals, as well as on the Australia Group's chemical export control list (India is not a member of the Australia Group). For example, Indian companies are capable of producing, or currently produce, 2-chloroethanol and thiodiglycol (both mustard precursors), phosgene, hydrogen cyanide (blood agent), and trimethyl phosphite and thionyl chloride (nerve agent precursors).

    India's capability to produce chemical weapons is greatly enhanced by the sophistication of its domestic chemical industry. A number of government-owned and private sector companies produce an array of dual-use chemicals that are potential chemical weapons precursors and intermediates. A number of the domestically produced chemicals can be found on the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) lists of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 chemicals, as well as on the Australia Group's chemical export control list (India is not a member of the Australia Group). For example, Indian companies are capable of producing, or currently produce, 2-chloroethanol and thiodiglycol (both mustard precursors), phosgene, hydrogen cyanide (blood agent), and trimethyl phosphite and thionyl chloride (nerve agent precursors).

Although Glavkosmos suspends the contract in 1993, ISRO claims that substantial cryogenic technology has already been transferred. A revised Glavkosmos-ISRO deal in the mid-1990s includes two cryogenic engines minus the technology transfer (two flight-worthy stages, two ground models, and an option for three more cryogenic engines are also added to the contract). In addition, Glavkosmos modifies the payment amount to $128 million. By September 1998, the first cryogenic stage arrives in India.

  </question>
  <passage>
    India views its nuclear weapons and long-range power projection programs as the key to maintaining strategic stability in the Asia-Pacific region, deterring Pakistan, safeguarding against potential nuclear threats from China, and attaining great-power status. Among all the developing states with aspirations for weapons of mass destruction and long-range power projection capabilities, India alone has achieved a unique degree of success. Outside the group of the five legally accepted nuclear weapon states and Israel, India perhaps harbors the most sophisticated ballistic and cruise missile programs in the world. India's strategic missile programs have matured to the extent that New Delhi can now deploy short- and medium-range nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles in an operational mode against Pakistan and China. Four decades of investments in a missile-related design, development, and manufacturing infrastructure have also made this sector less vulnerable to long-term disruption by technology denial regimes. More significantly, India's sophisticated civilian satellite launch capability makes it one of the few developing states theoretically capable of building an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) within this decade.

  <question>
    What are the various phases of India's missile programs? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    India's missile programs can be roughly divided into four phases. During the first phase (1958-1970), India's missile ambitions were confined to building a first-generation anti-tank missile (ATGM) and developing a three-ton thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engine most likely based on the Soviet SA-2 sustainer motor. Both projects were undertaken by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) with the objective of gaining scientific expertise and creating a technological infrastructure to build modern missiles indigenously in the long term; there were no plans for the immediate serial production of missile systems. However, the DRDO's technical and organizational shortcomings, opposition from the armed services, and weak support from politicians and civilian bureaucrats in the federal government resulted in the failure and ultimate termination of both projects. Phase II of India's missile program spans the decade of the 1970s. During this period, the DRDO undertook two significant projects. The first, Project Devil, was an attempt to &quot;reverse-engineer&quot; the Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM). The second, Project Valiant, was an ambitious attempt to develop a 1,500km-range ballistic missile. Both projects emanated from an alliance of interests between scientists in the DRDO, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and some of her influential bureaucratic advisors. Design competence and political symbolism were the primary objectives of both projects. For these reasons and because of the peculiarities of India's civil-military relations, the armed services were kept at the margins of the decisionmaking process. However, India lacked the scientific, engineering, and industrial base to build a long-range ballistic missile. Due to faltering progress, the Indian government terminated the Valiant program in 1974. On the other hand, Project Devil proved to be a partial success. Although Indian engineers were unable to reverse-engineer the SA-2 missile system entirely, they apparently succeeded in developing two solid-fueled boosters and a three-ton, liquid-sustainer engine for the Devil missile. The Indian government revived the flailing missile program in 1980 and in 1983 launched the Integrated Guided Missile Program (IGMDP) to develop a family of strategic and tactical guided missiles. The IGMDP involved the development of two strategic ballistic missile systems: two variants of a short-range ballistic missile (Prithvi), and a medium-range technology demonstrator (Agni). Under the program, the DRDO also sought to develop medium- and short-range SAMs (Akash and Trishul), and a third-generation ATGM (Nag). The years 1980-1994, the third phase in India's missile program, marked a crucial turning point. During this period, India's forays into missile building were transformed from exercises in technology-gathering, reverse-engineering, and design competence into a full-fledged program to build a series of operational missile systems. By 1996-1997, the successful development of the Prithvi-1 (150km-range) provided India with the technical option to deploy a limited nuclear strike capability against Pakistan. Similarly, two successful flight-tests of the 1,400km-range Agni missile validated India's &quot;re-entry vehicle&quot; technology. The Agni program thus served as a building block for the design and development of longer-range ballistic missile systems&amp;#8212;systems that would provide India with a nuclear strike capability against China in the future. The fourth phase of India's strategic missile program stretches from the mid-1990s to the present. This phase has been characterized by the partial success of IGMDP, and limited serial production of the Prithvi and Agni ballistic missiles. As a result of the armed services commitment to actually purchase indigenous missile systems, the DRDO has been able to shift its focus from technology demonstration to modifying missile systems to meet the field requirements of the user in terms of deployment and operability. Capitalizing on its successes with the Prithvi and Agni, the DRDO embarked on programs to develop shorter- and longer-range versions of the Agni (Agni-1 and Agni-III), a supersonic cruise missile (BrahMos) with Russian collaboration, and a naval variant of the Prithvi (Dhanush). The DRDO is also believed to be developing a sea-launched ballistic missile, the Sagarika, which is expected to become operational by 2010. In addition, India has sought Russian and Israeli collaboration in the development of an anti-tactical ballistic missile (ATBM) system.

    Why was the Agni missile developed? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The Agni missiles have been designed and developed for delivering nuclear munitions. Despite earlier suggestions of the Agni's potential conventional role, this is now unlikely for reasons of cost-effectiveness and accuracy. The Agni-I will most probably replace the Prithvi for nuclear-targeting missions against Pakistan. Although the longer-range variants of the Agni will inherently be capable of targeting Pakistan as well, they are primarily being developed as a nuclear strike capability against China.

    What is BrahMos? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    India is also developing a 280-300km-range/200-300kg-payload, supersonic cruise missile in joint partnership with the Russian entity, NPO Mashinostroyeniye.The joint development work on the missile was started in 1998, while the joint company establishing the program was registered in 1995. Derived from the Russian anti-ship missile called the Yakhont, the BrahMos is a dual-mode cruise missile, with its primary mode as an anti-ship missile, with a backup capability to attack shore-based, radio-contrast targets. The missile features a two-stage propulsion system employing a solid propellant booster with a liquid ramjet engine. Russia is believed to be primarily responsible for the propulsion system, while India has primary responsibility for the on-board guidance system.

    What kind of ballistic missiles do India possess? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    At present, the Prithvi-1 and Prithvi-2 are the only ballistic missiles in service with the Indian Army and Air Force respectively. The Prithvi missiles are inherently nuclear-capable, and an undisclosed number of Prithvi-1 missiles have been modified to deliver nuclear warheads. However, the Prithvi suffers from several limitations such as its short-range, liquid-fueled engine, which add to the logistics burden, and fuel toxicity, which increases the difficulty of handling the weapon system in the field. Hence the Prithvi missiles will most likely be replaced by the Agni ballistic missiles for nuclear missions. The missiles already in the inventory of the Army and Air Force are likely to be reassigned to perform conventional battlefield support functions. The DRDO has also developed a 350km-range naval-variant of the Prithvi: the Dhanush.

    Why didn't India join the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Despite its emergence as a potential &quot;second-tier&quot; supplier state, India is not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). New Delhi rejects participation in the MTCR on grounds that India is a victim of such technology-denial regimes, that such regimes are insensitive to India's national security needs, and they interfere with the peaceful uses of space technology. In the past, senior Indian defense officials such as Sivathanu Pillai and Dr. Abdul Kalam have expressed the view that Indian missile programs, both strategic and tactical, are not only aimed at providing the Indian military with weapon systems, but also to generate exports. In 1994, the Indian defense ministry's Department of Defense Production and Supplies included the Prithvi in its catalogue of defense items available for export. Although no Prithvi exports have occurred to date, Indian and Russian officials have publicly expressed their intent to export the BrahMos/PJ-10 cruise missile to friendly &quot;third countries&quot; with mutual consent.

    As a result, at the end of three decades, India's guided missile program has now assumed a self-sustaining character. Unlike the 1970s, the missile program is now guided by a clear strategic vision and buttressed by a diverse coalition with strong organizational stakes in politically and strategically determined technological outcomes. In retrospect, the guided missile program has not only become central to India's proposed &quot;minimal deterrent,&quot; but more significantly, it has emerged as the symbol of an independent, self-reliant, and strategically autonomous Indian state.

    What activities were part of the Iranian CW program? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Iran has a sophisticated base for the development of a chemical weapons program dating back to the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) -- a conflict that gave Iran strong incentives for developing a robust chemical defense capability. There are several unclassified allegations and reports that suggest Iran has developed an offensive CW program as well. Most of these claims cannot be verified in open sources. However, reports of transactions of various dual-use material is publicly known. Imports such as thiodyglycol and thionyl chloride can be applied towards legitimate purposes such as dyes, textiles, and pesticides or can be diverted towards an illicit CW program. Iran also imported several tons of phosphorus pentasulfide, which is on the Australia Group's watch list for controlled chemical precursors, but not on the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) Schedule lists. The compound has several legitimate uses in the agricultural industry, specifically relating to pesticides, but is also a starting point for nerve agents such as VX. Based on such information, some idea of Iran's CW status can be ascertained.

The New York Times reported in late March 1995 that, according to administration officials, Iran's military deployment on disputed islands in the Gulf included chemical weapons. Jane's Defense Weekly also reported in April 1995 that US Defense Secretary William Perry revealed that Iran had placed chemical weapons on disputed islands in the Persian Gulf. According to Pentagon officials, the weapons deployed on Abu Musa island were mostly 155mm artillery shells. The Journal of Commerce also reported that Secretary Perry said that Iran had deployed &quot;...6,000 troops, chemical weapons, and anti-ship missiles to unmanned islands in the Strait of Hormuz.&quot; Finally, according to a study by the National Defense University from April 1997, &quot;The United States believes that Iran has some weaponized biological weapons and a large chemical weapons stockpile, some of which are deployed on Abu Musa island in the Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz.&quot;

In 1992, the dispute over Abu Musa became more acute when Iran unilaterally tried to control the entry of third country nationals into the UAE portion of Abu Musa island. Tehran subsequently backed off in the face of significant diplomatic support for the UAE in the region, but in 1994 it increased its military presence on the disputed islands.

    According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the engineering research center is the government department responsible for all chemical development facilities. Iran established at least one large research and development center under the control of the center, which had allegedly established a significant chemical weapons production capability by mid-1989. The same source reports that the center focuses on research and production of VX. (However, perhaps one could question the accuracy of those allegations due to the Council's reference to VX as a &quot;biological agent&quot;). It is also reported that the Research Center is manufacturing an advanced fermenter designed by its own scientists.

    US experts believe that Iran has at least one chemical warhead assembly plant near Damghan. Middle East Defense News reports (spring 1988) claimed that &quot;neuro-toxic&quot; warheads (presumably nerve agent-type) were being assembled for Iran's Scud-B missiles at Damghan between the Semnan and Shahroud missiles complexes to the east of Tehran. Finally, in March 1988, Die Welt reported that, according to Iraqi intelligence, Iran had converted a medical factory in the area of Damghan into a CW munitions production factory. In a 1995 Special Report, Jane's Intelligence Review noted that the Damghan facility is suspicious because &quot;it has several characteristics of chemical weapon plants: isolation, links to transportation lines, and security. The facility at Damghan is hidden by trees, downwind of town, surrounded by fallow fields and linked to the railroad by a spur.&quot; The report states that in addition to the claims of 155mm shells, the facility also has loaded Scud-B warheads with nerve gas. The missile assembly facility is just 130km away and is connected by the same rail line.

According to US intelligence sources, CIG is making solid-fuel propellant powders for Iran's ballistic missile and artillery rocket programs. Within the CIG, a state-of-the art chemical plant was built by the Swedish group Bofors in Esfahan starting in the late 1970s as a dual-use fertilizer and explosives factory; however, the plant did not open until 1987 due to Iraqi artillery and missile barrages. The Bofors chemical plant in Esfahan produces TNT, RDX, Hexotol B, Hexotol B4, plastic explosives (C4), and nitrocellulose. Despite very large batch runs of TNT, Hexatol, and Hexogen, the plant operates with a staff of only 300 people since all primary filling lines are fully automated. Today, the plant is fully staffed by Iranians.

    Middle East Defense News also details the history of the Qazvin plant, built in 1987 by a consortium that included the German companies Lurgi Metallurgie GmbH, Bayer AG, and BASF (formerly of VEB Bitterfeld), Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, and an unidentified Yugoslav company. Signed by Iran's state-controlled Nargan Consulting Engineers, the contract stipulated that Iran would use the Qazvin facility to make Amiton, a powerful organophosphorus pesticide classified as a nerve agent by Western governments in the 1950s and withdrawn from the market because of its lethality. (Amiton is a Schedule 2 toxic chemical under the Chemical Weapons Convention.) To handle the deal, Bayer set up a subsidiary in Iran called Bayer-Iran Chemie and began importing equipment from the United States in 1987.

    On 23 June 1996, the Sunday Telegraph reported about a &quot;...secret multi-million-pound deal with the Indian government which will supply banned materials used to manufacture poison gas.&quot; Under the deal, India would build a sophisticated chemical plant at Qazvin, which would be used to produce phosphorus pentasulfide, a dual-use chemical that could be used to produce chemical weapons (e.g., VX nerve agent). The deal collapsed after details of the deal were disclosed in The Telegraph.

    The Bush administration imposes sanctions on several Chinese firms allegedly for selling CBW components to Iran. According to a US State Department statement, &quot;The penalties were imposed for the transfer to Iran since January 1, 1999 of sensitive equipment and technology controlled by the Australia Group.&quot; One unnamed US intelligence official reportedly told the Washington Times that in April 2001, US intelligence tracked one of the Chinese shipments of chemical-related goods as it made its way to Iran. The three firms penalized by the sanctions are Liyang Chemical Equipment, the China Machinery and Electric Equipment Import and Export Company, as well as Mr. Q.C. Chen. One of those firms produces glass-lined equipment; however, the reports did not mention if such equipment was transferred to Iran. The State Department statement goes on to say that &quot;Q.C. Chen is already subject to US sanctions. In May 1997, he was among seven Chinese entities sanctioned, pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for knowingly and materially assisting Iran's chemical weapons program through the transfer of chemical weapons precursor chemicals and/or chemical weapons-related production equipment and technology. These sanctions currently remain in place.&quot; The statement continues by claiming that the activities of Q.C. Chen and other Chinese entities have been brought to the attention of the Chinese government on numerous occasions, and that the Chinese government was informed in advance of the decision to place further sanctions on Mr. Chen and others.

    Iran's entanglement with CW stems from the legacy of the Iran-Iraq War. From approximately 1983-1988 during the war with Iraq, Iran suffered extensive CW attacks, including blister (mustard) and nerve agents. By the end of the War, Iran appeared to have suffered as many as 50,000 chemical warfare casualties, of whom perhaps 5,000 died.[1]

    While several Iranian leaders felt that developing a CW program would counteract the Iraqi threat and prove to be a strong deterrent, others within the clerical Islamic regime publicly condemned any use of chemicals on moral grounds, calling them un-Islamic. Disagreement over a course of policy action led to several contradictory published reports whether or not Iran decided to pursue a CW program. Although the status of its offensive capability is somewhat ambiguous, one can definitely conclude that Iran has a defensive program that can be re-engineered into offensive production, if Iranian national security is threatened.

    China has also been involved in several other sales to Iran, involving CW technology; as a result, several Chinese companies and individuals have faced American sanctions. One example was the 1997 sale by China to Iran of 40,000 barrels of calcium-hypochlorite, a chemical and biological decontaminating agent. Other defensive material purchased by Iran includes respirators from Spain, protective gear from South Korea, and atropine autoinjectors from the Netherlands.[6] In 1995, Asian-Ways, Ltd. World Co (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Mainway International Ltd. were sanctioned by the US State Department for supplying Iran with &quot;nerve gas technology.&quot;[7] According to US press accounts citing a top secret CIA report dated 2 October 1996, China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of carbon disulfide, a nerve and riot control gas precursor.[8] In 1997, two more Chinese companies and were sanctioned by the US State Department for selling Iran CW related precursors and equipment. The companies involved were Nanjing Chemical Industries Group and Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import/Export Corporation. They were accused of exporting thionyl chloride, dimethylamine, and ethylene chlorohydrin.

    From which countries did Iran import CW agents?

  <passage>
    Though there is no concrete evidence that Iran is currently developing CW, there have been several instances where CW precursors were purchased from foreign sources in the past. Throughout the 1980s, the United States accused Germany of selling dual-use materials and technology to Iran. In 1989 US authorities found Alcolac International Inc., a pharmaceutical firm based out of Baltimore, Maryland, guilty of illegally shipping almost 120 tons of thiodyglycol (a mustard gas precursor) to Iran. The same year, US Department of Commerce put export controls on 23 specific chemicals that could aid CW proliferation. Also in 1989, the State Trading Corporation of India admitted that it had sold Iran over 60 tons of thionyl chloride (a nerve agent precursor) and that its supplier was planning to ship an additional 257 tons of the chemical to Iran. In 1997, under a reported multi-million dollar deal, India agreed to construct a &quot;sophisticated chemical plant at Qazvim, on the outskirts of Tehran.&quot;[4] India also agreed to sell Iran phosphorous pentasulfide, a dual-use chemical used in the production of pesticides as well as the nerve agent VX. The deal eventually fell apart and a similar deal was eventually concluded with China in 1998. China reportedly agreed to sell Iran 500 tons of phosphorus pentasulfide.[5]

    Iran continues to deny any allegations that it is actively pursuing an offensive CW program. In 1996, it held the first regional seminar on the national implementation of the CWC in Tehran so that government authorities could familiarize themselves with their duties and obligations under the treaty. It also held a mock &quot;trial inspection&quot; at the Shahid Razkani chemical factory to allow inspectors to see how such a procedure was conducted. Iran submitted a declaration on its chemical facilities and its past CW stockpile, it has destroyed chemical weapons production equipment in the presence of OPCW inspectors, and it has undergone a number of OPCW inspections of its chemical industrial facilities. Iran continues to play an active role at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), is recognized as a member in good standing, and currently serves on its executive council. Although US and Israeli intelligence agencies continue to insist Iran maintains a stockpile of chemical weapons, no challenge inspections of Iranian facilities have been requested, and none of the allegations made regarding the stockpiling of CW can be verified in the unclassified domain. However, Iran continues to retain a strong incentive for developing a defensive CW program.

    After 11 consecutive days of missile strikes on each other's capitals, it appears as if Iran and Iraq are ending reciprocal bombardment. Iraq signals its willingness to end the missile exchanges with Iran, but on its own terms. The first term is that Iraq should make the last bombardment since, as Iraq claims, Iran initiated the exchanges with two missile attacks on Baghdad on 29 February. Iran is believed to have fired the last missile. Iran has launched nearly 30 missile strikes against Baghdad and Iraq has launched more than 50 against Tehran. The Iraqi overture for a cease-fire appears prompted from concern about the damage to civilian morale.

    What is Iran's current missile capability? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long-range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors, Israel and US forces deployed in the region. A large number of these systems currently possess the capability to delivery chemical, biological or radiological dispersion warheads. If conditions remain favorable, it will be able to extend the reach of its ballistic missile forces to include Southern Europe, North Africa, and South Asia by 2005-2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015. A true nuclear weapons delivery capability could be obtained within the next five years. Any one of a host of international or domestic factors, however, could accelerate or delay these developments.

  <question>
    What does Iran's missile inventory consist of? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Available information suggests that Iran has a current ballistic missile inventory of 325-550 systems: 200-300 Shehab-1, 100-150 Shehab-2, 25-100 Shehab-3, and 1-5 Shehab-4/5 prototypes. The relative numbers of Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 systems could change in favor of the Shehab-2 if Iran undertakes to upgrade the earlier systems to Shehab-2 configuration. Reliable estimates of long-range artillery rocket (e.g., Fajr, Nazeat and Zelzal) inventories are unavailable. These totals could quickly be increased should Iran make the decision to either purchase additional systems from the DPRK or accelerate Shehab-3 production.[2] Although information is sparse, Iran is believed to field the equivalent of two surface-to-surface missile brigades. The first is equipped with Shehab-1 systems. This unit consists of six-twelve MAZ-543P TELs and unknown number of MELs. It is believed to be organized into two-three battalions. The second is equipped with Shehab-2 and Shehab-3 systems. It consists of approximately four-six Shehab-2 TELs and four-eight Shehab-3 MELs and is believed to be organized with one-two Shehab-2 and one-two Shehab-3 battalions. Each brigade is believed to have an operational test and evaluation responsibility for its respective missile systems. It is likely that a third brigade equipped with the Shehab-3 will be formed by 2005. There may also exist a small number of independent Shehab-2 or -3 units of battalion size. There are also an unknown number of long-range artillery rocket units, some perhaps of brigade size.

Iran launched approximately 339 (80 Scud-Bs/Shehab-1s, 253 Oghabs, and 6 Shahin-IIs) and Iraq launched about 193 (189 al-Husayns and 4 Scud-Bs). Of the 80 Scud-B/Shehab-1s launched by Iran, 64 were targeted against Baghdad. The remaining were aimed at Mosul (9), Kirkuk (5), Tikrit (1), and Kuwait (1). These attacks brought the total number of Scud-B class missiles fired by the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force during the war to approximately 120.[19] This campaign witnessed the complete depletion of Iran's inventory of R-17 Scud-Bs acquired from Iran and Syria.

Washington has thus far refused to allow a deal between Westinghouse Electric Corporation of the United States and Ukraine that provides Ukraine with two nuclear plants, and will not allow any deal to take place until an agreement is reached on the Iranian reactor. He says the United States may even pay Ukraine for financial losses it sustains from scrapping the Iranian deal.

    n North Africa and the Middle East, states of proliferation concern -- Libya, Syria, Iran, and Iraq -- remain poised to develop and use all means at their disposal to threaten U.S. and allied interests in the region and beyond. U.S. conventional military superiority paradoxically creates an incentive for adversary states to acquire NBC weapons. Because our potential adversaries know that they cannot win a conventional war against us, they are more likely to try asymmetric methods such as employing biological or chemical weapons or threatening the use of nuclear weapons. This strategy also applies to particular terrorist groups intent on inflicting a large number of casualties or causing panic, if such groups judge that conventional means are inadequate and they do not fear political or military retaliation.

    Does Iran have a secret bioweapons program? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Iran is often accused in Western circles of secretly developing an offensive biological warfare (BW) program. In a 1996 report to the US Senate, the Central Intelligence Agency claimed that &quot;Iran has had a biological warfare program since the early 1980s. Currently the program is in its research and development stages, but we believe Iran holds some stocks of BW agents and weapons...&quot;[1]

    Iran has shown an interest in acquiring BW agents from foreign sources. The speaker of the Iranian parliament publicly stated in 1988 that &quot;...we should fully equip ourselves in defensive and offensive use of chemical, bacteriological, and radiological weapons.&quot;[2] Canadian and Dutch scientists were approached by Iranian personnel looking to acquire mycotoxin-producing fungi (Fusarium spp.) in 1989. Sources also claim that Iran has pursued the acquisition of castor beans (known to be used for producing the deadly toxin ricin)[3] and retains several cultures of the anthrax-producing bacteria Bacillus anthracis.

    These scientists are supposedly experimenting with the causative agents of such diseases as Marburg, smallpox, plague, and tularemia. According to Michael Eisenstadt, Iran &quot;probably is researching such standard agents as anthrax and botulin toxin and it has shown interest in acquiring materials which could be used to produce ricin and mycotoxins.&quot;[4] Another report indicates that &quot;Iran has...conducted extensive research on more lethal active agents like anthrax, hoof and mouth disease, and biotoxins.&quot;[5] It must be noted that this latter source, cited by Anthony Cordesman, cannot be independently corroborated, and firsthand data on Iranian BW agents is unavailable in open sources. Some of the most common agents that are associated with the Iranian BW program in the open literature are B. anthracis, botulinum toxin, ricin, T-2 mycotoxin, and Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. (A table of cultures that Iran is known to possess is available in the Biological Capabilities section.)

    How much bioinsecticide is produced each year at the Biotechnology Institute of the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST)? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    nitial research focused on laboratory-scale projects concentrating on the &quot;application of Bacillus thuringiensis against Anopheles larvae.&quot; This research lead to the construction of a biotechnology pilot plant in 1989 for the production of B. thuringiensis. The pilot plant, shown below, was inaugurated in 1990 and produces more than two tons of bioinsecticide per year. As of January 1999, Dr. Nassrin Azimi has been in charge of one of the five biotechnology groups at the center. The center has continued to work on many biotechnology projects at both the laboratory and semi-industrial levels. One of the most successful projects involved producing bacterial insecticides in cooperation with UNESCO.

  <question>
    Are there any suspected links between IROST and Iran's biological or chemical weapons programs? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    There are no known accusations that IROST or the PTCC are connected in anyway with biological weapons. However, the PTCC does maintain a significant collection of bacteria and fungi that could be used in a biological warfare (BW) program. For instance, the PTCC maintains cultures of Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis--both of which have been weaponized by other countries in the past. The PTCC also maintains cultures of Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Salmonella paratyphi, Vibrio cholarae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella boydii, Shigella blexneri, and Cryptococcus neoformans. While it is possible that these pathogens could be weaponized, they have not been the focus of BW programs in other countries in the past. Finally, the PTCC maintains cultures of Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, and Bacillus thuringiensis. While these agents are not dangerous to humans, they have been used in bioweapons programs in other countries in the past to simulate biological weapons. For instance, B. thuringiensis is very similar to B. anthracis and has been used by other countries to perfect the equipment and techniques necessary to produce and disseminate it. The first project undertaken by IROST appears to have been the cultivation, pilot production, and dissemination of B. thuringiensis. The technologies used for this project would have been directly applicable to the cultivation, production, and dissemination of B. anthracis.

  </question>
  <passage>
    In addition to these programs, the Agricultural Biotechnology department also has conducted significant research on species of Fusarium, fungi that attack wheat crops and produce T-2 and other trichothecene mycotoxins. In 1988 and 1989, Iranian scientists contacted Canadian and Dutch research institutes in an effort to purchase strains of fusaria. These efforts were blocked by the Canadian and Dutch governments for fear that Iran may have planned on using the fungi to develop T-2 mycotoxin for a BW program.[1] In the years following these attempts, Russian and US intelligence speculated that Iran maintained an active BW program focused on the development of mycotoxins.[2] However, it is unclear if these speculations were solely an extrapolation from the 1989 Canadian and Dutch purchase attempts or if the allegations rely on other classified intelligence. Regardless of the allegations, the fusaria research conducted by the Agricultural Biotechnology department appears to be completely benign.

    The Iran Brief reports that some of Iran's &quot;major universities and research organizations may be linked to its biological warfare program. Hints of the Iranian program have emerged in bits and pieces in recent years, as mysterious explosions have occurred in Switzerland and Germany at warehouses where biological fermenters were being prepared for shipment to Iran. The main alleged supplier was a subsidiary of Bayer in Germany....On July 8, 1996, the Commerce Department announced that it had fined one US supplier, Sigma Chemical Company of St. Louis, Missouri, $480,000 for having made 48 shipments of biotoxins to various destinations since 1991. Many of those shipments went to Iran. On two occasions, the company applied for licenses to ship biological materials and enzymes to Iran in 1990 and 1991, but was refused. Sigma's client on those occasions were the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and the Biochemistry Institute of Tehran.&quot;

The New York Times reported in late March 1995 that, according to administration officials, Iran's military deployment on disputed islands in the Gulf included chemical weapons. Jane's Defense Weekly also reported in April 1995 that US Defense Secretary William Perry revealed that Iran had placed chemical weapons on disputed islands in the Persian Gulf. According to Pentagon officials, the weapons deployed on Abu Musa island were mostly 155mm artillery shells.  The Journal of Commerce also reported that Secretary Perry said that Iran had deployed &quot;...6,000 troops, chemical weapons, and anti-ship missiles to unmanned islands in the Strait of Hormuz.&quot; Finally, according to a study by the National Defense University from April 1997, &quot;The United States believes that Iran has some weaponized biological weapons and a large chemical weapons stockpile, some of which are deployed on Abu Musa island in the Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz.&quot;

    History: The Ministry of Jihad-e Sazandegi (or &quot;striving for construction and development,&quot; better known as Construction Crusade) was formed in 1983 by Imam Khomeini and the Islamic Consultative Parliament to address poverty through rural development and construction and agricultural growth and self-sufficiency. The ministry played a crucial role in the Iran-Iraq War by constructing strategic bridges, floating bridges, floating vehicles, submarines, freeways for armored vehicles, and special vehicles for use in marshy fields. In the spring of 1983, the office dedicated to army engineering research was moved from war fronts in the south of Iran to Tehran. This Engineering Research Center was the starting point for Jihad-e Sazandegi's future engineering research activities.

The same source notes that the Research Center, now managed by Fadhlallah Wakili-Fard, was originally supposed to be part of the Defense Ministry, but was established separately by IRGC Minister Muhsin Rafiqdust as a means of covering its true intent. According to Paula A. De Sutter, the Construction Crusade acted as the corps of engineers for the IRGC, aiding in the production of material for Iran's biological, nuclear, chemical and missile programs. In 1986, the Tehran Domestic Service reported the IRGC Minister's announcement that &quot;the armament industries of the Corps have made notable progress in the missile, aircraft, biological, chemical and nuclear fields.&quot;

    13 February 1986 Iran's UN Ambassador, Said Rajaie Khorassani, accuses Iraqi planes of attacking the Iranian city of Abadan with chemical weapons. Although he gives no direct figures on the numbers of killed by CW in Abadan, Khorassani claims 2,500 Iranians have been injured and 20 killed by mustard, nerve, and blood agents in the past few days. He goes on to accuse the UN Security Council of &quot;callousness and irresponsibility&quot; in not condemning Iraq's CW use and other violations of international law. Khorassani says he officially asked Secretary General Perez de Cuellar to send a team to investigate the attacks. In response to the Iraqi claims that Iran had used CW against Iraq, Khorassani responded that it was a &quot;big lie&quot; and that &quot;when we use it, we will say it.&quot; He warns that &quot;if Iraq uses [CW] one more time, we have to use these weapons if they continue.26 February 1986 The New York Times states that &quot;although [Iraq and Iran] have accused each other of using chemical weapons, there has never been any evidence that Iran has used them in the five-and-a-half year war, according to US and United Nations officials.&quot; (Note: The Times did not mention the names of the officials to which they are referring.]

    Which chemical weapons were used against Iranian forces in the Iran-Iraq war? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    12 March 1986 The UN mission sent to investigate Iraqi chemical weapons attacks in Iran conclude that, &quot;Based on evidence gathered during this second visit to Iran, the UN mission unanimously concluded that chemical weapons have been used in the Abadan area against Iranian positions by Iraqi forces. Medical examinations and testimony of Iranian and Iraqi casualties evacuated from the Al-Faw area further confirmed the use of chemical weapons in that war zone by Iraqi forces. Delivery weapons were identified as aerial bombs filled with mustard gas. The mission also concluded that the sheer number of casualties [over 70] seen in Tehran and Ahvaz would indicate an escalation in the use of chemical weapons in 1986 compared to 1984...we unanimously conclude that: (a) On many occassions, Iraqi forces have used chemical weapons against Iranian forces; (b) The agent used has mainly been mustard gas although on some occassions nerve gas was also employed.&quot;

    23 November 1986 Simon O'Dwyer-Russell, defense correspondent for the Sunday Telegraph of London, reports that unidentified Western intelligence officials believe that Iran and Syria have acquired nerve gas warheads from the Soviet Union via Libya. These sources say that the warheads can be attached to Scud-B missiles. It is not clear when Libya may have received the warheads, but British intelligence is reported to have &quot;traced the source of the nerve agent back to the Soviet Union.&quot; The warheads can reportedly kill everyone within a 25-square mile area, although such an impact is clearly being overstated.

Supposedly, the two countries will work together to increase the range of the Scud-B missile, as well as to develop Libya's al-Fatah missile. The Western intelligence report was issued after a visit to Tripoli by an Iranian Ministry of Defense delegation, and the sources cite past cooperation between the two countries.

    1 June 1995 Jane's claims Damghan &quot;is the location of a chemical warhead production facility... It has several characteristics of chemical weapons plants: isolation, links to transportation lines and security. The facility at Damghan is hidden by trees, downwind from town, surrounded by fallow fields, and linked to the railroad by a spur. The perimeter road lies just outside the grove of trees. There are no signs of bunkers, so munitions are probably moved by rail to arsenals on a regular basis. Although reports state that 155mm artillery shells are the major product, the plant reportedly also loads other weapons with nerve gas. According to Critical Mass, by Burrows and Windrem, Scud-B warheads have been loaded with nerve gas at this facility. Since the missiles are assembled 130km to the southwest in Semnan, which lies on the same rail line, it would take little effort to ship the missiles to Damghan before they are deployed.&quot; ?&quot;Special Report, Damghan,&quot; Jane's Intelligence Review ?

Greenburg and Defino would stand to make 1 cent a pound in profit. Charles Tanaka, an export-import agent in Japan, initiated the deal. Dennis Bass, a special agent for the US Customs Service, intercepts 120 tons of poison gas chemical precursors on their way to Iran from Alcolac International in Baltimore.

    Some Western sources believe that Iran first developed its BW program during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). Currently, its growing biotechnology industry does have the potential to divert dual-use agents for illicit warfare purposes. There are several reasons why Iran would pursue a BW program, including establishing a deterrent against Iraq, establishing regional dominance, or developing an alternative to conventional weapons for asymmetric conflicts. Some experts speculate that in its biological arsenal, Iran possess agents such as botulinum toxin, B. anthracis, and ricin.

    The Bush administration imposes sanctions on several Chinese firms allegedly selling CBW components to Iran. According to a US State Department statement, &quot;The penalties were imposed for the transfer to Iran since January 1, 1999 of sensitive equipment and technology controlled by the Australia Group.&quot; One unnamed US intelligence official reportedly told the Washington Times that in April 2001, US intelligence tracked one of the Chinese shipments of chemical-related goods as it made its way to Iran. The three firms penalized by the sanctions are Liyang Chemical Equipment, the China Machinery, and Electric Equipment Import and Export Company, as well as Mr. Q.C. Chen. One of those firms produces glass-lined equipment; however, the reports did not mention if such equipment was transferred to Iran. The State Department statement goes on to say that &quot;Q.C. Chen is already subject to US sanctions. In May 1997, he was among seven Chinese entities sanctioned, pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for knowingly and materially assisting Iran's chemical weapons program through the transfer of chemical weapons precursor chemicals and/or chemical weapons-related production equipment and technology. These sanctions currently remain in place.&quot; The statement continues by claiming that the activities of Q.C. Chen and other Chinese entities have been brought to the attention of the Chinese government on numerous occasions, and that the Chinese government was informed in advance of the decision to place further sanctions on Mr. Chen and others.

Kharrazi notes &quot;Iran does not seek weapons of mass destruction and, unlike the US ally in this region, is a party to the NPT, CWC, and BWC and has signed the CTBT. As the only victim of weapons of mass destruction in the last generation, Iranian people have felt the horror of these weapons and are determined to ensure that no people will have to go through the same agony...It must be underlined that, unlike the United States, weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran's defense doctrine. Iran is fully committed to observing all relevant international instruments on prohibition of such weapons, and its compliance has been repeatedly verified by the relevant international organizations. At the same time, Iran insists and vigorously pursues its inalienable right to develop its nuclear, chemical, and biological industries for peaceful purposes. This right is guaranteed in all relevant international instruments, and the deliberate campaign by the United States to arbitrarily deprive Iran of this right is a further violation of these regimes.&quot; Kharrazi further states that he believes that the Bush administration seeks to weaken these regimes, so that it remains &quot;unhindered not only in developing and proliferating such weapons but more dangerously in leveling self-serving accusations against others.&quot;

    Is Iran able to use conventional methods of attack? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    hus, to appreciate the military situation in the Gulf, one must bear in the mind that Iran is not capable of attacking any Gulf Arab state (other than Iraq) with conventional weapons in anything other than a punitive, though possibly painful way. The prospect of invasion across the Gulf is nonexistent for the foreseeable future. An Iranian attack, punitive or otherwise, would be futile militarily and would occasion massive U.S. and Gulf retaliation.

    What is Damghan? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Jane's claims Damghan &quot;is the location of a chemical warhead production facility... It has several characteristics of chemical weapons plants: isolation, links to transportation lines and security. The facility at Damghan is hidden by trees, downwind from town, surrounded by fallow fields, and linked to the railroad by a spur. The perimeter road lies just outside the grove of trees. There are no signs of bunkers, so munitions are probably moved by rail to arsenals on a regular basis. Although reports state that 155mm artillery shells are the major product, the plant reportedly also loads other weapons with nerve gas.

Libya sees the United States as its primary external threat, owing especially to U.S. support for UN sanctions against Tripoli for its refusal to turn over suspects in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103. Although Libya's capabilities to use chemical agents and missiles are limited, Qadhafi could provide these weapons to states he supports and that support him in return.

    n addition, Tripoli has looked to establish an indigenous chemical warfare program, and in late 1988, with extensive foreign assistance, completed construction of the Rabta chemical agent facility.

These technical shortcomings, combined with limitations in Libya's overall ability to put agents into deliverable munitions, will preclude production of militarily effective biological warfare systems for the foreseeable future.

If a missile were offered with range sufficient to strike 2,500 kilometers into Europe, Libya would try to obtain it.

  <passage>
    On the other hand, we have evidence of how proliferation occurs: not by governments waking up in the morning with the thought that they have good dual-use technology, so why not make a bomb? Rather, states determined to acquire WMD seek coherently and systematically to procure the equipment needed for that purpose. The Indian and the North Korean nuclear programs were consciously dual-use from the beginning with a view to put these technologies to military use. Israel received the needed facilities from France for the single purpose of building nuclear weapons. Pakistan and Iraq started out with complex procurement operations for weapons purposes. Iraq and Libya did the same for chemical weapons. The push was political, and the technology followed, not the other way around.

    From which countries has Libya received chemical weapons assistance? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    There are reports of two other underground chemical weapons facilities being constructed, one near Tarhunah, 65 miles southeast of Tripoli, and another near Sabah, 460 miles south of Tripoli. Libya has received foreign assistance in its chemical weapons program from many countries. In October 1996, a German national was convicted in a German court for selling a computer to Libya that was designed to be used in chemical weapons production, and for helping Libya import emission treatment for poison gas production from India using an _Irish_ dummy corporation. There have also been reports that China, North Korea, Germany, Switzerland, and other European nations have given technical support and provided advisors.

    The South African government has denied a 21 June 1998 report by Con Coughlin in the British newspaper &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; that it concluded a $418 million arms-for-oil deal with Libya. South African President Nelson Mandela said that he maintains a close relationship with Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi, but a statement issued by Mandela's office said that &quot;the government wishes to put on record that neither President Nelson Mandela nor the South African government and its agencies have entered into any discussions - let alone concluded any deals - with Libya on arms for oil transactions.&quot;

  </question>

    The &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; alleged that South Africa would supply Libya with weapons, spare parts, and possibly biological and chemical weapons information in exchange for Libyan oil. According to the &quot;Sunday Telegraph,&quot; the deal was negotiated by Libya's foreign security and intelligence chief, Musa Kusa, and will also include advanced equipment such as surface-to-air missiles. South Africa has previously agreed to provide Libya with spare parts for its attack helicopters and Mirage fighter aircraft. South Africa has also considered selling its Rooivalk combat helicopter to Libya. According to Coughlin, South African officials are very concerned with preserving the country's defense industry. One South African official said &quot;we will do business with any country that will reciprocate.&quot;[1]

  <passage>
    There is very limited open-source information indicating Libya is pursuing a biological weapons (BW) program. The country acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) on January 19, 1982, but questions remain regarding Libya?s compliance with the treaty. There are allegations that the alleged chemical weapon (CW) plants at Rabta and Tarhunah could contain BW research facilities as well. U.S. intelligence agencies have alleged that Libya?s leader, Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, has attempted to recruit South African scientists to assist in the acquisition of BW, and that Libya has started to develop pathogens and toxins for weapons use. If so, security experts believe that Libya is several years away from acquiring a militarily significant indigenous BW capability. Libya?s government strongly denies acquiring or producing BW.

  <question>
    What motivated Libya to pursue a chemical weapons program? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Western experts view the pursuit of CBW as a means of bolstering Libya's military capability, since the country lacks effective conventional ground, air, or naval forces. Libyan CBW programs may also represent a bid by Colonel Qadhafi to offset Israel's nuclear capability with weapons often called the &quot;poor man's atomic bomb.&quot; This motivation may stem from Libya's thwarted efforts to obtain its own nuclear capability. Thus far, Libya has been unsuccessful in its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons because of international sanctions and the fact that it lacks the necessary financial and technical resources. Qadhafi's pursuit of CBW capabilities is of concern to the international community because of his often erratic behavior and the fact that Libya is believed to possess two of the largest CW production complexes ever constructed in the developing world.

    Libya's official position is that it does not have a CBW program and that its chemical production facilities are intended solely for peaceful purposes.2 But informed observers believe these denials demonstrate Qadhafi's penchant for &quot;saying one thing and doing the exact opposite.&quot;

    According to published reports, the Rabta plant was built with the help of private companies from a dozen nations, including both Western and Eastern bloc countries. Firms from Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy, as well as Japan, provided Libya with the technology and materials to manufacture chemical weapons. The German firm Imhausen-Chemie AG played a central role in construction of the Rabta facility. In 1989, Imhausen reportedly contracted with Salzgitter Industriebau, another German company, to supply plans for a large chemical plant to produce highly toxic materials at Rabta.7 Other German firms also cooperated with Imhausen but claim that they believed they were delivering goods for a pharmaceutical plant being built in Hong Kong. Imhausen used this cover story to move sensitive goods through its Hong Kong-based trading company, Pen Tsao Materia Medica Center, which had a branch in Hamburg and was able to circumvent German export controls.8 The German equipment and supplies were transshipped through Hong Kong and Singapore before reaching Libya

    In the late 1980s, a Japanese company, Nihon Seikojo, or Japan Steel Works, played a major role in the construction of the metal-working plant at the Rabta complex.17 The company stated that it had delivered general-purpose machine tools, which it believed would be used for a desalinization plant. However, the proximity of the metal-working plant to the CW factory indicated that the Libyans intended to fabricate munitions and delivery vehicles for poison gas. Japan Steel Works subcontracted the electrical system for the machine shop to Toshiba in 1985.

    What is Libya's capacity for producing CW artillery shells at Pharma 150? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    In March 1991, U.S. intelligence officials reported that in the vicinity of Rabta, Libya had built a new complex of S-shaped concrete bunkers covered with sand, which contained special equipment to assemble poison gas artillery shells and bombs.29 The United States warned that this development represented a new phase in Libya's efforts to acquire a CW capability.

    The Tarhunah facility, extending over six square miles, is a labyrinth of tunnels carved into the side of a hollowed-out mountain.40 The plant's entrance is located in the middle of a long, narrow valley between two mountain peaks, making it difficult for spy-satellites to view the factory or for fighter aircraft to destroy it. The plant also is virtually impregnable to conventional air attack because of three 450foot-long tunnels, protected above by 100 feet of sandstone and several feet of reinforced concrete.41 To make the plant even more difficult to attack, Libya reportedly obtained blueprints used by the former Soviet Union to build underground bomb shelters.42 Apparently, only a direct hit on the top of the mountain with a nuclear warhead would be capable of destroying the facility.

    Libya has land- and sea-launched short-range anti-ship cruise missiles that it purchased from Soviet and European sources, which are potential means of delivery for NBC weapons. Many of the systems are old and likely are suffering from maintenance problems. In the future, while Libya likely will continue to focus on its anti-ship missile capabilities, it may try to purchase land attack cruise missiles

    Iran first acquired SCUD-B ballistic missiles from Libya and North Korea and used them during the Iran-Iraq war.

    Iran has a two-track ballistic missile program. In addition to acquiring SCUD missiles and missile-related equipment from North Korea, it also seeks to establish its own missile production capability. Its production program is planned for both liquid-fueled and solid-propellant missiles. As part of the process, Iran has already begun assembling missiles using foreign-made components and eventually it may produce these components domestically. Further, it is actively attempting to acquire other assistance and missile-related technology from a variety of foreign sources for its goal of producing an MRBM.

    Libya has a long history of subverting and destabilizing Arab and African nations by supporting coups, funding and training opposition forces and guerrilla groups, and plotting the assassinations of foreign leaders. Qadhafi has invaded, occupied, and/or claimed territory in all of Libya's neighbors except Egypt. He has at times supported foreign Islamic extremists, and he has frequently criticized Arab governments that have attempted to open dialogue with Israel.  Under Qadhafi's leadership, Libya remains a potential threat to the international community and neighboring states. While pursuing his political and military aspirations, he has squandered the country's oil wealth on a program for NBC weapons, missiles, and an enormous inventory of conventional military equipment. Since seizing power in 1969, Qadhafi has unsuccessfully attempted to turn the Libyan state into a regional military power. Qadhafi has demonstrated both his desire to acquire ballistic missiles and an NBC weapon capability as well as his willingness to use the capabilities at his disposal. In 1987, when his military operation against Chad was nearing defeat, Qadhafi ordered his forces to use chemical agents against Chadian troops. In response to U.S. retaliatory strikes for the terrorist bombing of a Berlin discotheque, Qadhafi fired SCUD missiles at the Italian island of Lampedusa. Although the SCUD missiles did not cause significant damage, the act constituted a symbolic gesture of defiance directed at the United States and the international community. Finally, and more importantly, Qadhafi has ordered kidnappings and both supported and employed international terrorism against Western nations.

His numerous schemes to form political unions with other Arab states have failed, and his support of insurgent and opposition movements has done little to enhance Libya's standing or further its policy agenda. Qadhafi's continued support for terrorism has resulted in an extended confrontation with the United States and, more recently, has prompted United Nations sanctions.

    In the future, as Iran becomes more self-sufficient at producing chemical or biological agents and ballistic missiles, there is a potential that it will become a supplier. For example, Iran might supply related equipment and technologies to other states trying to develop capabilities, such as Libya or Syria. There is precedent for such action; Iran supplied Libya with chemical agents in 1987.

    Libyan leader Qadhafi is a leading advocate of Pan-Arabism and views himself as a revolutionary voice for developing countries and defender against Western imperialism and Zionist influences. His ideology has led to numerous unsuccessful attempts to form unions with other Arab states, support to insurgent and opposition movements in developing countries, and an extended period of confrontation with the United States and, more recently, the United Nations. Although Qadhafi has retreated from supporting subversion, destabilization, and terrorism in hopes of having the UN sanctions against Libya lifted, Libya has retained a significant infrastructure to support terrorist activities against Western interests.

    How do dual-use technologies foster the proliferation of NBC weapons? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    we have evidence of how proliferation occurs: not by governments waking up in the morning with the thought that they have good dual-use technology, so why not make a bomb? Rather, states determined to acquire WMD seek coherently and systematically to procure the equipment needed for that purpose. The Indian and the North Korean nuclear programs were consciously dual-use from the beginning with a view to put these technologies to military use. Israel received the needed facilities from France for the single purpose of building nuclear weapons. Pakistan and Iraq started out with complex procurement operations for weapons purposes. Iraq and Libya did the same for chemical weapons. The push was political, and the technology followed, not the other way around. Does all this mean we should be complacent about technology diffusion? Not at all. But the direction of concern must be different: it is not the growing number of &quot;virtual arsenals&quot; that is of concern.

Included were South Africa, for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs; Egypt, for its rocket program and interest in chemical weapons and supply links to Iraq; Libya, for its missile, chemical weapons, and nuclear projects. Also included were Angola and Somalia, for chemical weapons use, and Algeria for its Chinese-aided clandestine nuclear program.

    Western experts view the pursuit of CBW as a means of bolstering Libya's military capability, since the country lacks effective conventional ground, air, or naval forces. Libyan CBW programs may also represent a bid by Colonel Qadhafi to offset Israel's nuclear capability with weapons often called the &quot;poor man's atomic bomb.&quot; This motivation may stem from Libya's thwarted efforts to obtain its own nuclear capability.

    Prior to 1990, Libya produced about 100 tons of chemical agents -- mustard and some nerve agent -- at a chemical facility at Rabta. However, it ceased production there in 1990 due to intense international media attention and the possibility of military intervention, and fabricated a fire to make the Rabta facility appear to have been seriously damaged.

    How has North Korea's chemical weapons program progressed over the past 50 years? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    By 1954, the KPA established nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) defense units, probably along the lines of the Soviet model. According to some accounts, North Korea's offensive CW program also began at this time, relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development. Kim Il-sung's &quot;Declaration for Chemicalization&quot; in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production, and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau (NCDB) was also established during this time. In 1966, for reasons that are unclear, the DPRK later turned to the Soviets for assistance in CW, mostly in the form of training manuals and small quantities of nerve and mustard agents. Following this period of Soviet-led assistance, North Korea made substantive gains in the area of chemical warfare. Still, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW, while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step.

    inally, by the late 1980s, it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity, and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance. In January 1987, the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons, including blister (mustard) and nerve agents. Recent estimates of North Korean chemical ordnance by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense (MND) have since been raised to the thousands of tons, probably based on recent information provided by North Korean defectors, including former members of DPRK military and NBC defence organizations.

  </question>
  <passage>
    During the first Seven-Year Plan (1961-1967, and adjusted further to 1970), the DPRK was able to increase production of chemical products while expanding their variety. The Pongung Chemical Factory began with a vinyl chloride production line, inaugurating the &quot;February 8 Vinalon Plant&quot; in 1961. This factory was the first major step for the DPRK to fully involve itself in organic chemical industry. Other industrial plants followed, including the H?ngnam Fertilizer, Pongung chemical, Aoji Chemical, Chongsu Chemical, Hwas?ng and Sunch'?n Chemical factories. This nascent chemical sector, however, remained at a relatively low level in terms of overall quality. The Aoji and Hwas?ng chemical plants were largely based on coal, and ammonia and caustic soda were produced primarily at the Pongung factory. Carbide dominated the production lines at Chongsu and Sunch'?n. Currently, North Korea has an estimated calcium carbide production capacity of at least 550,000 tons per year. The production of calcium carbide is especially important in the case of North Korea, as it can be used to generate acetylene for organic synthesis (especially synthetic polymers).

    Commodity chemicals including lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide (current production capacity said to be 150,000 tons), calcium carbide, and ammonia make up the first tier of intermediates. Acetic acid, phthalic acid, methanol, benzene, toluene, and xylene make up the second tier in the DPRK's organic chemical industry. Sulfuric acid is produced at the lactic acid plants in the H?ngnam Fertilizer Complex, the Munpyong and Nampo refineries, and as a by-product at the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Complex. The DPRK claims to have a production capacity of 800,000 tons of sulfuric acid, more than half of which is made at H?ngnam. Caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) is produced the February 8 Vinalon Complex, Sinuiju Chemical Factory, and 60 other smaller production facilities. The DPRK is estimated to have a production capacity of 200,000 tons for ammonium nitrate and nitric acid, 75% of which is produced at the H?ngnam Fertilizer Complex. Overall chemical fertilizer outputs in the DPRK reportedly increased more than 400% from 1960 to 1975 (462,000 tons in the latter year). In 1989, the DPRK claimed it had produced 5.6 million tons of chemical fertilizers of all types. Nonetheless, the Bank of Korea estimated that only 770,000 tons of chemical fertilizers were actually produced in 1997. One estimate puts production of nitrogen-based fertilizers (ammonia sulfate), ammonia, and synthetic resins in the DPRK at 700,000 tons spread out across the H?ngnam Fertilizer Complex, Aoji Chemical Factory, Namhung Youth Chemical Complex, the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex, February 8 Vinalon Complex, and the Aoji Petrochemical Factory.)

    As in most other sectors in the DPRK, shortfalls in energy production and aging factory equipment mean that North Korea has an under-performing chemical sector. Most of North Korea's chemical products appear to be limited to polymer-based manufacturing, producing large quantities of polyethylene, acrylonitrile, and vinalon (polyvinyl alcohol). Unfortunately, few countries have any demand for vinalon, which is an inferior textile fiber. Only four basic products from petroleum, such as acrylics and other polymer fibers, were produced in North Korea as of 1995. As of 1998, the DPRK was still unable to produce nylon and polyester in significant quantity, while the opposite is true for vinalon (&quot;Chuch'e fiber&quot;).

    Why are North Korean commerical chemical plants suspected of being chemical weapons facilities? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Some of the active and reserve Nuclear and Chemical Defense battalions are also reportedly based at some of these chemical complexes. However, because photographs of some of these manufacturing sites have been published, and thus their location and other details compromised, one must consider their role in the military production of CW agents as questionable at best.  As part of a &quot;heavy industry,&quot; chemicals are a key component to the command socialist economy in the DPRK, in which all production is under governmental control. With the emphasis of an economy based on military preparedness, it is not an exaggeration to say that all chemical production (as well as other segments of heavy industry) is militarized in the DPRK. Despite numerous reports alleging large-scale CW production, the extent to which chemicals are diverted or produced for chemical warfare in North Korea is not clear.

At Kanggye and Sakchu, CW agents brought from the Fifth Machine Industry Bureau are filled into artillery (including mortar and artillery rocket) shells, which are requisitioned from the Third Machine Industry Bureau. Reportedly, chemical spray tanks and aerial munitions are also prepared at Sakchu and Kanggye, and can be filled with CW agent from bulk storage at various airfields right before their use in wartime. Also associated with the offensive part of the chemical weapons apparatus, Factory No. 279 is responsible for defensive material, including decontamination chemicals, protective suits, and detection equipment.

    Comprising seven different units, the NCDB is actively involved in the research and development of weapons, as well as nuclear and chemical defense. These are divided into the following departments: operations, training, materials, technology, reconnaissance, section No. 32, and mining/underground facility operations. No. 32--an organization of which very little is known--has been linked with research and development of chemical weapons and perhaps specialized warheads for chemical delivery on the Nodong-1. Three additional research institutes (???=???)--No. 55, No. 710, and No. 398--also operate under the aegis of the NCDB. Apparently, No. 710 research institute is involved in laser-related technology, possibly for weapons applications, with a research staff of about 250. With approximately 250 researchers, the No. 398 research institute is involved in decontamination operations in both nuclear and chemical environments and is reportedly developing antidotes, masks, and suits. The No. 55 research institute has about 70 on its research staff and is responsible for simulating nuclear and chemical contamination for decontamination operations and training.

According to Yi, the battalion had a nuclear/chemical reconnaissance company (1st Company), while the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th companies were described as &quot;decontamination&quot; units. The 6th company was responsible for flame-throwers and presumably obscurant smokes (also referred to as &quot;Smoke Screen Company&quot;). The latter had once been located in Sadong-kuy?k, Pyongyang, and was transferred to the 18th Battalion in June 1993, also according to Lee. Interestingly, none of these companies that were described by Lee had specific duties with regard to offensive use of chemical weapons, but were responsible mainly for reconnaissance and decontamination operations.

By 1954, the KPA established nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) defense units, probably along the lines of the Soviet model.

    What was the scope of North Korea's chemical weapons program in the late 1980s? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Finally, by the late 1980s, it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity, and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance. In January 1987, the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons, including blister (mustard) and nerve agents. Recent estimates of North Korean chemical ordnance by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense (MND) have since been raised to the thousands of tons, probably based on recent information provided by North Korean defectors, including former members of DPRK military and NBC defence organizations.

    Reflecting Soviet military doctrine, the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive. There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War. The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians. Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea's artillery and rocket systems and, today, the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack.

    North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents, not to mention their manufacture and storage. To be sure, the wide availability of oil-derived intermediates, especially ethylene oxide, makes the large-scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK. However, it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents, such as sarin, soman, and VX, without putting a great burden on already limited resources

  </question>
  <passage>
    During the 1990s, the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network. For example, in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50kp of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK. Ostensibly, this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes. But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents, the Japanese authorities arrested the individual (himself a Japanese citizen) for trading in a controlled substance. The relatively small amount (50kg) of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent. But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea, namely the lack of domestically-manufactured chemical precursors.

  <question>
    What was the United States' response to the discovery that North Korea had an operational highly-enriched Uranium production facility? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The U.S. responded by announcing in November 2002 that it would suspend heavy fuel oil shipments being provided under the terms of the Agreed Framework, which had led North Korea to freeze plutonium production facilities. Pyongyang then declared the following month that it was lifting the freeze on its nuclear program, ostensibly in order to generate electricity. In late December 2002, North Korean technicians broke seals and disabled cameras that had been installed by the IAEA in order to monitor the freeze. North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors on 31 December 2002, curtailing the Agency?s capacity to monitor Pyongyang?s nuclear activities. The IAEA has not been able to verify the completeness and correctness of North Korea?s initial declaration submitted in 1992, and the Agency cannot verify whether fissile material has been diverted to military use.

    North Korea's chemical weapon (CW) production capability is estimated to be about 4,500 tons per year, though this could increase to 12,000 tons per year in case of war. North Korea appears to have emphasized the weaponization of mustard, phosgene, sarin, and V-type chemical agents. Reports indicate that North Korea has some 12 CW facilities where raw chemicals, precursors, and actual agents are produced and/or stored, and six major storage depots for CW ordnance. North Korea also has placed thousands of artillery systems?including multiple launch rocket systems that are particularly effective for CW delivery?within reach of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and Seoul. Pyongyang has not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

    What biological weapons development occurs at North Korea's No. 25 Factory? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Biological Facilities No. 25 Factor Primary Function: Production of biological warfare (BW) agents Following Kim Il Sung?s November 1980 order to develop biological and chemical weapons, North Korea accelerated its biological weapons development by deploying special personnel to the No. 25 Factory, the Microbiological Institute (??????),and the Medical Institute (?????). The No. 25 Factory is reportedly a site for biological weapons production. According to a 1992 report by South Korea?s Agency for National Security Planning (???????), North Korea produces 13 types of BW agents, such as bacillus anthracis (anthrax), cholera, typhoid bacillus and plague bacteria at the No. 25 Factory, the Party Central Biological Research Institute (????????), and the Preventive Military Medical Unit (????????). The report says that these BW agents are sent to the  Munch??n Agar Factory (??????) for weaponization.

    According to defector Hwang Jang-yop, North Korea is prepared for a full-scale offensive into South Korea. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-il believes his troops could successfully seal off any reinforcements to the US forces already in South Korea because Tokyo and many other Japanese cities, as well as US military installations in Japan would be exposed to direct missile attacks from North Korea. All heavy equipment of the Korean People's Army is self-propelled. The North Korean military openly brags that it can destroy South Korea with a blow three times more powerful than anything South Korea might be able to mete out against strategic targets in North Korea.

    Many senior officials in North Korea believe that the international tension fuelled by the North Korean nuclear issue was due to foreign authorities having entrapped North Korea with the safeguard agreement of 1992. Thus, many officials feel North Korea should stockpile large amounts of chemical weapons. North Korean leaders have confirmed that they would not join the treaty on the prohibition of testing biological and chemical weapons. Officials have conceded the possession of such weapons.

  </question>
  <passage>
    There are also concerns about North Korea's suspected highly enriched uranium (HEU) program, which is a different path to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In the summer of 2002, US intelligence reportedly discovered new evidence about transfers of HEU technology and/or materials from Pakistan in exchange for ballistic missiles. In October 2002, a delegation led by James Kelly, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, visited Pyongyang and notified North Korean officials that the United States was aware of Pyongyang's HEU development program. Compared to plutonium-production facilities, the type of HEU production facilities that the DPRK may be developing would be difficult to detect, and therefore, it is difficult to accurately assess the program's stage of development. Most reports indicate the program was initiated in the mid-1990s, but there is evidence that the program could have begun as early as the 1980s. Most indications are that the HEU program is employing gas-centrifuge technology, but when the program exactly began is still unclear. There are also reports that North Korea is seeking or experimenting with laser-isotope separation technology, but it is unlikely that Pyongyang will be able to apply this technology in the foreseeable future.

    How did Soviet Union help North Korea in its nuclear program? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    In the early 1960s, the Soviet Union provided extensive technical assistance while North Korea constructed its Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, which included the installation of a Soviet IRT-2000 Nuclear Research Reactor, and other facilities (see Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center). The small research reactor has been used to produce radioisotopes and to train personnel. The cabinet and the Academy of Sciences were given operational and administrative oversight of the nuclear facilities, but ultimate control of the program and decisions over weapons development belonged to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. The program appeared to begin as a peaceful one, but whatever Kim's original intentions, the Cuban Missile Crisis may have prompted initiation of a dedicated nuclear weapons program.

    Why did North Korea fail to meet the IAEA deadline? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    After signing the NPT, countries have 18 months to complete a safeguards agreement with the IAEA. In North Korea's case, it was later discovered that the agency provided the wrong documents for the safeguards agreement and the IAEA subsequently gave North Korea an additional 18 months to complete the agreement. Nevertheless, North Korea failed to meet the extended deadline, as Pyongyang demanded that the United States withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea, and that Washington and Seoul terminate the joint military exercise "Team Spirit."

  </question>
  <passage>
    This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world. If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed, the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons. (It is not clear, however, if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves.) Reportedly, the CW agents in the DPRK arsenal include all of the major classes, such as phosgene (choking), hydrogen cyanide (blood), mustard (blister) and sarin (nerve agent). However, a 2002 report from the commander of US Forces in Korea, General Thomas A. Schwartz, also suggests that North Korea is self-sufficient only in World War I era CW agents--these would include compounds such as phosgene, Lewisite, and mustard blister agents, but not the more potent nerve agent classes.

    What does the North Korean CW arsenal contain? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents, primarily mustard, phosgene, sarin, and V-series nerve agents. (Other reports from DPRK defectors--including allegations of a &quot;nitrogen, sulfur, and mercury&quot; chemical weapon that causes &quot;respiratory paralysis&quot;--seem rather farfetched.) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime, and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime. An unknown portion of CW agents are stored in bulk, but a significant portion is reported to be filled into artillery shells and rocket warheads. Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents, it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene, mustard, sarin, and V-agents. (Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent.) In 2001, it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals, precursors, and CW agents are produced and/or stored. CW agents are then moved to either a Sakchu- or Kanggye-based chemical weapons facility for weaponization, i.e., the filling of weapons with agents for deployment. It is also reported that shipments of CW agents are conducted in such a way so as not to attract undue attention, and are camouflaged as ordinary military cargo.

    Open-source assessments of North Korean chemical weapons stockpiles have changed significantly over the past decade. Reports by defectors and other accounts in the open literature indicate that North Korea currently possesses blister (e.g., mustard), nerve (e.g., sarin), choking (e.g., phosgene), and blood agents (e.g., hydrogen cyanide). A North Korean defector in 1997 told a US Congressional committee that the DPRK possessed a blister agent called &quot;Lizut,&quot; or Lewisite, in its arsenal. VE and VG nerve agents are also mentioned in South Korean assessments of DPRK chemical weapons, although these reports do not appear to be based on hard data but rather on inference.

    North Korea first entered the field of rockets and missiles in the early 1960s with the production of multiple rocket launchers.[1] By 1965, Kim Il Sung had probably made the political decision to seek an indigenous ballistic missile production capability. That year marked the establishment of the Hamhung Military Academy, where North Korean personnel began to receive training in missile development.[2] In general, the 1960s marked the procurement of rockets, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), anti-ship missiles, and the initial development of human resources to support a missile program.

    According to the US State Department, in October 2002 North Korea admitted to a US government delegation that it had a uranium enrichment program. However, North Korean officials subsequently claimed they only admitted to having &quot;a plan to develop nuclear weapons.&quot; At this time, it is uncertain whether North Korea has enriched any uranium. According to a November 2002 unclassified CIA assessment, &quot;North Korea embarked on the effort to develop a centrifuge-based uranium enrichment program about two years ago.&quot;[1] Moreover, the CIA report estimated that North Korea is building a centrifuge plant that could be fully functional by &quot;mid-decade&quot; and could then produce enough weapons-grade uranium (typically greater than 90% enriched uranium) for two or more weapons per year. North Korea's uranium enrichment program may have begun as early as 1995, possibly with the assistance of Pakistan.[2] In March 2000, then-President Bill Clinton could not certify that North Korea was not manufacturing or otherwise acquiring HEU.

    US authorities are investigating an agreement by an US company to transfer thiodiglycol to Iran, circumventing US export control laws. The company, Alcolac of Baltimore, MD, began shipping the chemical in February 1987 for Colimex, a West German company now named Chemco GmbH. The February shipment made first went to Norfolk, VA, where customs officials intercepted the shipment and replaced the drums of thiodiglycol with drums of water. The agents then tracked the shipment to Singapore, where it was then transshipped to Karachi, Pakistan. In Pakistan, the shipment was again transferred, this time to an Iranian ship called the SS Iran Ekram. From Karachi, the shipment was sent to Bandar Abbas, Iran, where it was off-loaded. From there, it made its way to a company in Tehran.

The phased plan called for reciprocal visits, military exercises, officer education, troop training and strategic planning activities.

  <passage>
    Pakistan embarked on a nuclear weapon program in the early 1970s after its defeat and break up in the Indo-Bangladesh war of 1971. Islamabad regards nuclear weapons as essential to safeguard the South Asian balance of power and offset its conventional inferiority and lack of strategic depth against India. The technological complexity associated with nuclear weapons and their systems of delivery is also closely tied to Pakistan's post-colonial identity as the first Muslim nation to have acquired such a capability.

By the mid-1980s, Pakistan had a clandestine uranium enrichment facility; and as early as 1989-1990, the United States concluded that Islamabad had acquired the capability to assemble a first-generation nuclear device. Pakistan is believed to have stockpiled approximately 580-800 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), sufficient amounts to build 30-50 fission bombs. In 1998, Pakistan commissioned the Khushab research reactor, which is capable of yielding 10-15 kg of weapons-grade plutonium annually. According to the United States, China helped Pakistan by providing nuclear-related materials, scientific expertise, and technical assistance.

    The United States seeks to persuade India and Pakistan to exercise restraint in their nuclear and missile programs and to bring their programs into conformity with international standards. The consequences of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan would be catastrophic, both in terms of the loss of life and in lowering the threshold for nuclear use in other parts of the world, particularly the adjacent Middle East/North Africa region. Deployment of ballistic missiles would pose especially troubling security risks, given the relatively short distances between major population centers in South Asia and the brief time required for missiles to travel such distances.

    Unlike India, Pakistan has never tested a nuclear device, although after the 1996 press reports of Indian test preparations, Pakistani government officials insinuated that Pakistan had the capability to conduct a nuclear test and would do so if India did. Pakistan has taken the public position that if India would sign the NPT, it would also. Like India, not all of Pakistan?s nuclear facilities are under IAEA safeguards.

    As far as Pakistan is concerned, the lifting of all nuclear sanctions was triggered principally by the practical necessity of cooperating with Pakistan after September 11. I don't think that otherwise all nuclear sanctions would have been lifted. Right now the Bush administration has to court Pakistan, because the United States needs Pakistan for operations in Afghanistan.  One factual point: the decision to lift the sanctions was taken before September 11 and before the need to get Pakistan to work with us on this campaign. I know this for a fact. It was just a question of when to announce it and how to do it.

    Why is Pakistan of strategic importance to the US in a post 9/11-world? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Of course, there is enormous concern about what is going to happen in Pakistan. If U.S. goals are restricted to Osama bin Laden and the destruction of his terrorist network, this will have a lesser impact on Pakistan. But if U.S. goals expand to include the removal of the Taliban, it could lead to a crisis within Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment, and at that point, questions about political instability will arise. In the medium and long term, the United States is going to be focused on ensuring that Pakistan remains a moderate Islamic state. Washington is likely to try and ensure political stability and the return to democracy in Pakistan. The United States will also exert strong pressure on Islamabad to continue its policy of strategic restraint. Finally, it will press Pakistan to reevaluate its support for the Taliban and to assess seriously the possible blowback from efforts to dislodge the Taliban in Afghanistan, that is, to recognize the danger that Pakistan might itself at some stage become the victim of &quot;Talibanization.&quot;

    Pakistan's ballistic missile infrastructure is now more advanced than that of North Korea. It will support development of a missile of 2,500-km range, which we believe Pakistan will seek in order to put all of India within range of Pakistani missiles. The development of a 2,500-km missile will give Pakistan the technical base for developing a much longer range missile system. Through foreign acquisition, and beginning without an extensive domestic science and technology base, Pakistan has acquired these missile capabilities quite rapidly. China and North Korea are Pakistan's major sources of ballistic missiles, production facilities and technology.

    How could India and Pakistan's NBC capabilities affect US policies in the region? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    India and Pakistan are not hostile to the United States. The prospect of U.S. military confrontation with either seems at present to be slight. However, beyond the possibility of nuclear war on the subcontinent, their aggressive, competitive development of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction poses three concerns in particular. First, it enables them to supply relevant technologies to other nations. Second, India and Pakistan may seek additional technical assistance through cooperation with their current major suppliers-India from North Korea, Iran and Russia; Pakistan from North Korea and China-because of the threats they perceive from one another and because of India's anxieties about China, combined with their mounting international isolation. Third, their growing missile and WMD capabilities have direct effects on U.S. policies, both regional and global, and could significantly affect U.S. capability to play a stabilizing role in Asia.

  </question>

    For example, Pakistan's test launch in April 1998 of its Ghauri medium range ballistic missile (MRBM)-its version of the North Korean No Dong-could not be predicted on the basis of any known pattern of technical development either for MRBMs generally or Pakistan in particular. Similarly, North Korea's decision to deploy the No Dong after what is believed to be a single successful test flight is another example. Based on U.S. and Russian experience, the Intelligence Community had expected that a regular test series would be required to provide the confidence needed before any country would produce and deploy a ballistic missile system. Yet North Korea deployed the No Dong.

  </question>
  <passage>
    China?s alleged sale of nuclear-related equipment to Pakistan jeopardizes $10 billion in loans and other financing awaiting approval by the Import- Export Bank, the chief US guarantor of credit for overseas sales. A 1994 nuclear non-proliferation law requires President Clinton to cut off the credit, and frantic efforts by administration officials have uncovered no alternatives. The dispute merely presages debates congressional debates in the summer of 1996 over China?s trade status  Reports that China provided nuclear aid to Pakistan have created tension between the US and China and may indirectly threaten the tenuous peace between China and Taiwan. The foreign ministers from China and Pakistan deny the reports that China provided machinery for concentrating uranium to Pakistan. If the reports are confirmed, the Clinton administration could levy strict economic sanctions against China for violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Such sanctions, however, could jeopardize the US?s attempts to discourage China from attacking Taiwan.

Inside the containers, customs officers discovered a reactor with a cooling sheath, distilling equipment, pumps, and centrifuges. According to the exporting company, Smith Kline, the equipment was for manufacturing an antibiotic called cefadrin. The cargo, which originated in Rome, is being held for customs violations.

  </question>
  <passage>
    In addition, we remain concerned that neither side has fully implemented its bilateral agreements. Talks between Indian and Pakistani Foreign Secretaries intended to address regional security concerns and consider confidence-building measures have not been held since January 1994. Noncompliance with existing agreements may actually be adding to regional tension. In bilateral meetings with both India and Pakistan, ACDA has encouraged establishment of a joint implementation body to oversee the monitoring of current confidence-building measures and address disputes that might arise. We stressed the value of continuing arms control/CBM discussions regardless of political differences. At the moment, however, the prospects that a CBM dialogue between India and Pakistan will resume are slim. With little success to date, and with lack of trust on both sides, many Indians and Pakistanis question the propriety and efficacy of strategic CBMs. Many argue that personal and economic ties need to be built and small steps taken before measures to address regional military tensions can be effective.

    While in Pakistan, Dr. Perry made arrangements to reconvene the U.S.-Pakistan Defense Consultative Group. Its first meeting took place in Washington in May. During the visit of Pakistan's Prime Minister Bhutto in April, the President expressed his commitment to work with Congress to modify the Pressler Amendment (section 620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act). In January 1996, the President signed into law the Brown Amendment, which will permit economic and humanitarian assistance, counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, and IMET, and will allow a one-time release of $370 million in military equipment for which Pakistan had paid but not received due to implementation of the Pressler sanctions in 1990. The President decided that release of 28 F-16s, for which Pakistan had also paid, would be inconsistent with U.S. nonproliferation goals. Instead, the U.S. is seeking to help sell the aircraft to a third party and return the proceeds to Pakistan.

Many of the components for new binary agents developed by the former Soviet Union are not on the CWC's schedules of chemicals and have legitimate civil applications, clouding their association with chemical weapons use. However, under the CWC, all chemical weapons are banned, whether or not they are on the CWC schedules.

    What chemical weapons does Russia have? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    RUSSIA'S CW STOCKPILES Although generally known as &quot;poison gases,&quot; most CW agents are actually liquids. For use in warfare, they would be dispersed as an aerosol mist by spraying or explosive detonation. There are two major types of CW agents: blister agents, such as mustard gas, and nerve agents, including sarin, soman, and VX. A third class, choking gases like chlorine and phosgene, was used extensively from 19151918, but is not a major part of current CW stockpiles.

Glavkosmos is marketing a joint Russian-Kazak space launch service.

Leakages may include sophisticated but uncontrolled conventional military technologies and weapons such as fuel-air explosives.

    Russia has claimed that as much as 2,300 metric tons of metallic arsenic can be obtained from their lewisite stockpile; with prices for semiconductor-grade arsenic between $1,000-2,000 per kilogram, this conversion would appear, on first glance, to provide a significant amount of money for the country's chemical weapons disposal program

    he current Russian government is doing little to convince the people that it is any more concerned about their well-being than past governments were. Promised infrastructure improvements are not being constructed at chemical weapons storage sites. In addition, the Russian government does not acknowledge that many sites around the country are contaminated because of past chemical weapons disposal decisions. The medical concerns of ex-chemical weapons workers and of people living near contaminated former production and disposal sites are not being adequately addressed. At present, the chosen two-stage disposal technology for Russian nerve agents is being challenged. Protesting villagers near the areas where the government has decided to bury the resulting waste products from weapons disposal at Leonidovka are trying to prevent this decision from ever being implemented.

Fifty million rubles and three years of construction went into this project.15 Unfortunately, the military conducted the construction effort in total secrecy with no public information about the nature of future materials to be processed at the new plant. When construction entered the final stages, Chapayevsk citizens learned of the CW processing plans and reacted with heated protests.

    How could a terrorist organization obtain CW from Russia's stockpiles? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    21 To emphasize the current danger of CW theft, a potential terrorist scenario will be outlined in the following paragraphs. The conditions described at the sample facility reflect those depicted in Dr. Smithson's report (See Table 3). Under the cover of night, a terrorist unit makes its move. Upon entering the storage compound, the unit encounters chain-link or barbed wire fences surrounding the perimeter of the facility (some either rusted or with holes). The terrorists pass directly through the worn fences or perhaps through one of the poorly secured side entrances. Only the main gates are consistently guarded; side entrances provide several alternative routes for entry and escape. Perimeter lights are scant and in poor condition, providing camouflage for potential theft. The absence of intruder alarms at the multiple entryways makes entrance easy. Once inside the compound, the terrorist team moves easily to the individual CW storage buildings. There they find run-down buildings constructed of cement or wood, with either steel or wooden doors. Entry can be obtained by slipping through holes in the roofing, or by picking the single-key padlocks on the doors. No guards are present outside the storage units to deter the assailants.

    Once chemical weapons are in the hands of a terrorist group, carrying out a CW attack on an unsuspecting civilian population could prove to be simple. There are a variety of chemical munitions that are relatively small in size, making them easy to conceal and transport. Protective clothing and gas masks are commercially available. Compared to nuclear weapons, chemical weapons would be much more straightforward to employ. Chemical weapons are not protected by the Permissive Action Links (PALs) that are often placed on individual nuclear weapons.33 Stolen chemical munitions could be delivered using many existing conventional systems, or in homemade reconfigured designs. Although such use would require some effort and coordination, the Aum example suggests that it would be possible for an organization with sufficient resources and technological infrastructure. Terrorist groups such as Aum need only show their capability and willingness to acquire and use WMD to threaten US national security, since &quot;backpack-sized chemical or biological weapons, too small, improvised, and fragile to have an impact on a battlefield or against soldiers equipped for chemical and biological defense, could nonetheless be devastating against some civilian targets.

    Which countries could hide chemical weapon production? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The production methods for chemical weapons are harder to detect than those for nuclear weapons. The feed chemicals used for production of CW have myriad commercial uses such as production of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and even pen ink. Much of the equipment and processes are also used in commercial enterprises.13 Developed countries with many diverse commercial chemical production plants could hide illicit production. Underdeveloped countries would attract more attention in their procurement processes through the types of raw materials they purchase or produce domestically. The types of plant facilities they import and assemble, such as high-quality, corrosion-resistant reactors, piping, and valves or sophisticated filtration systems may also attract attention. Still, supply-side nonproliferation is extremely difficult because of the dual uses of chemicals and equipment.

  <passage>
    Chemical weapons may be unitary or binary in design. Unitary weapons are ready to use, but can be less stable and may have a shorter shelf life. Binary weapons have two separate component chemicals that are mixed just prior to launch to form a lethal agent. In advanced binary munitions, the two chemicals combine while the shell or warhead is en route to the target. Binary precursors are listed under Schedule 2 of the CWC, but the component chemicals of some binary chemical weapons may not be on any CWC schedule.

    In the process of detecting CW production, there are two types of effluents released from a chemical plant: controlled smokestack emissions and &quot;fugitive&quot; emissions.15 Smokestack emissions are planned emissions from the production facility and would be filtered. Fugitive emissions are stray emissions in either production, testing, or storage and would be unintended. Chemical weapons production would be easier to detect through the unintended or accidental release of effluents since they would not be filtered or disguised and probably would be in greater concentration than planned emissions. However, essentially perfect timing would be required to catch fugitive emissions;

    How large is Russia's arsenal of NBC weapons? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The collapse of the Soviet Union left Russia with the largest arsenal of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the world. Unclassified U.S. estimates of the current number of Russia's nuclear warheads range from 18,000 to 25,000, and Russia inherited an estimated 600 metric tons of the uranium and plutonium that could be used to build nuclear devices. Russia also assumed control of more than 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons and an extensive complex of sites used in research on dangerous biological pathogens, such as smallpox and anthrax, and the development of those pathogens as biological weapons.

    What information does DOD have regarding Russian CW site locations? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    DOD has limited information on the location and security of Russian sites with dangerous biological pathogens because the Russian government has provided limited access to and information about these sites. While DOD plans to address internal and external security threats at biological sites in Russia, it has no time frames for completing this work, and it has not determined how many biological sites in Russia should receive security improvements. After more than 4 years of effort, DOD has made little progress in addressing security concerns at these sites. As of December 2002, DOD had installed security equipment at two sites to protect against external security threats but had not addressed insider threats by increasing controls over access to materials or improving physical security within labs. U.S. efforts to secure biological sites in Russia have faced significant challenges. For example, the Russian government has closed many sites to U.S. security assistance programs, and the United States has been unable to negotiate an agreement with Russia that would expedite DOD's ability to provide security assistance.

The United States and Russia have collaborative research projects at 49 Russian biological sites, a number that includes many former biological weapons facilities. These sites have provided participating U.S. agencies with opportunities to observe the security needs at these sites.3 However, DOD has projects under way and thus direct knowledge of the security needs at only 14 of the 49 sites. DOD's information on the other sites is limited because DOD officials have to rely on other U.S. agencies to notify the department if they observe dangerous pathogen collections or have biosecurity concerns at the facilities where they operate. However, U.S. agencies have not received full access to information at the biological sites because the managers of these facilities are concerned about Russian national security and want to conceal former participation in the Soviet biological weapons program, according to a DOD official.

    Biological sites have unique characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to internal security threats, however. Experts have stated that there is a greater threat of potential proliferation of dangerous pathogens from insiders than from an outside attack because biological pathogens are small and can be smuggled out of a site without detection. According to a U.S. biosecurity expert, managers at Russian biological sites have been slow to acknowledge the potential of internal security threats. For example, officials at the Russian biological sites we visited stated that they knew their staff well and would notice if an individual posed a security threat because laboratory staff live and work in close quarters. These officials recognized the potential for insider security threats and said they would consider measures to mitigate these threats.

These facilities specialized in animal diseases that are communicable to man, such as plague, tularemia, anthrax, and cholera. According to DOD officials, the ministry was concerned that participation in Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs would be an admission that the antiplague centers had taken part in the Soviet biological weapons program. DOD also lacks access to four former Ministry of Defense biological weapons sites. These laboratories were involved in pathogen- and toxin-related research and maintained large pathogen collections. A major animal pathogen institute of the Ministry of Agriculture also remains closed to biosecurity assistance. DOD has made some progress in gaining access to one of the four Ministry of Defense facilities. In August 2002, U.S. Senator Richard Lugar was instrumental in initiating discussions with the management of the former Ministry of Defense facility, Kirov-200 (Strizhi), about potential collaborative research projects, according to a DOD official. The Russian government has nearly completed a transfer of ownership of the facility from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of Education. This institute's new civilian status is expected to enable future security projects with DOD.

    Since the early 1990s, DOD has focused its nonproliferation efforts on the construction of a facility to destroy Russia's 40,000 metric ton stockpile of chemical weapons. Because construction of the facility was taking longer than expected, in fiscal year 2000, Congress directed DOD to develop additional plans to protect Russia's chemical weapons storage sites. DOD has since developed plans to address external threats at two chemical weapons sites that store nerve agent in small portable munitions. DOD plans to complete this work in fall 2003 but has no plans to extend the program to the five other sites, three of which store nerve agent and two that store blister agent. As a result, a large quantity of chemical weapons in Russia will remain vulnerable to theft or diversion.

    n 1998, under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),1 Russia declared that it had stockpiled 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, the largest stockpile in the world. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),2 the implementing agency of the CWC, conducts inspections at chemical weapons facilities and reports its findings to member states, including the United States. OPCW regularly inspects Russia's chemical weapons stockpile. DOD has information concerning the quantity, location, and physical security conditions at Russia's declared chemical weapons storage sites and has plans to address external security at two sites. However, chemical weapons are stored at seven sites in Russia (see table 2). Five of these sites store nerve agent, which is considered the most dangerous form of chemical weapon.

    Is it easy to obtain Russian CWs? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    his stems from the inadequate protection of Russian CW stocks. Poor physical obstacles, the absence of electronic security devices, and rudimentary inventory practices make the Russian CW storage facilities susceptible to theft. Even Russia's own military officers have described the security measures at these facilities as &quot;inadequate,&quot; pointing out that the chemical arsenal is &quot;more vulnerable to theft&quot; since the locations of Russia's seven storage facilities have become a matter of public record.20 In 1995, Dr. Amy Smithson published a Stimson Center report, &quot;Improving the Security of Russia's Chemical Weapons Stockpile,&quot; based on interviews with visitors to the CW facilities. The report offers disturbing insights into the condition and accessibility of the Russian CW storage facilities.21 To emphasize the current danger of CW theft, a potential terrorist scenario will be outlined in the following paragraphs. The conditions described at the sample facility reflect those depicted in Dr. Smithson's report (See Table 3). Under the cover of night, a terrorist unit makes its move. Upon entering the storage compound, the unit encounters chain-link or barbed wire fences surrounding the perimeter of the facility (some either rusted or with holes). The terrorists pass directly through the worn fences or perhaps through one of the poorly secured side entrances. Only the main gates are consistently guarded; side entrances provide several alternative routes for entry and escape. Perimeter lights are scant and in poor condition, providing camouflage for potential theft. The absence of intruder alarms at the multiple entryways makes entrance easy. Once inside the compound, the terrorist team moves easily to the individual CW storage buildings. There they find run-down buildings constructed of cement or wood, with either steel or wooden doors. Entry can be obtained by slipping through holes in the roofing, or by picking the single-key padlocks on the doors. No guards are present outside the storage units to deter the assailants. The absence of tamper-detection seals, electronic intruder sensors, or video cameras at the individual storage buildings allows the terrorist unit to enter undetected. Inside the storage buildings, the terrorists find munitions and missile warheads stacked in &quot;wine-rack&quot; type storage units, with only production lot numbers (not serial numbers) tracking their existence. Containers for the missile warheads and bulk CW storage drums are typically unsealed. The terrorists need simply remove a few munitions or warheads and place them into a backpack before escaping into the night. It might take days for the missing CW weapons to be noticed, leaving ample time for the terrorists to threaten a civilian target. The frightening potential for CW theft by terrorists is summarized by one of Smithson's interviewees, who warned, &quot;You could really walk into that place without any problem.

    Who is responsible for tracking Russian CW stockpiles? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    In the Russian system, individual officers are personally responsible for keeping track of hundreds of chemical weapons, typically stored throughout several buildings. Although written records are kept, no computers have been installed to log and inventory the massive quantities of munitions. It is also unclear whether inventory records are updated to reflect the periodic removal of leaking munitions. Further, although the officers are held personally responsible for CW whereabouts, it is actually enlisted soldiers who conduct the inventory. At present, there is no established method for cross-checking inventories on a routine basis. Since tamper-detection seals on the weapons are rare, this could result in one or more soldiers and/or officers removing small quantities of CW munitions over time without detection.

    Although Dr. Smithson's report states that the soldiers interviewed at the CW facilities did not appear to be discontented, these soldiers probably suffer from erratic and paltry pay, as has been reported for soldiers at nuclear weapons facilities. Massive Russian CW stockpiles, lack of inventory practices, poor security measures at storage facilities, depressed economic conditions, and widespread military and government corruption create a climate ripe for CW theft from within. One of Dr. Smithson's sources offers a sobering prediction: &quot;Sooner or later, someone will make the soldiers at these sites a better offer than Moscow does. If something was missing, it is likely to be an inside job.

  <passage>
    Once chemical weapons are in the hands of a terrorist group, carrying out a CW attack on an unsuspecting civilian population could prove to be simple. There are a variety of chemical munitions that are relatively small in size, making them easy to conceal and transport. Protective clothing and gas masks are commercially available. Compared to nuclear weapons, chemical weapons would be much more straightforward to employ. Chemical weapons are not protected by the Permissive Action Links (PALs) that are often placed on individual nuclear weapons.33 Stolen chemical munitions could be delivered using many existing conventional systems, or in homemade reconfigured designs. Although such use would require some effort and coordination, the Aum example suggests that it would be possible for an organization with sufficient resources and technological infrastructure. Terrorist groups such as Aum need only show their capability and willingness to acquire and use WMD to threaten US national security, since &quot;backpack-sized chemical or biological weapons, too small, improvised, and fragile to have an impact on a battlefield or against soldiers equipped for chemical and biological defense, could nonetheless be devastating against some civilian targets.

  </question>
  <passage>
    The Chemical Weapons Convention The CWC is the most comprehensive and intrusive multilateral treaty ever signed. The CWC prohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer, and use of CW.10 The CWC calls for the destruction of any CW stockpiles and production facilities. The CWC even prevents assistance to other states in acquiring a CW capability. It involves the monitoring of both government and commercial sectors of chemical production, requiring extensive reporting by each.

    Who could hide chemical weapon production? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The production methods for chemical weapons are harder to detect than those for nuclear weapons. The feed chemicals used for production of CW have myriad commercial uses such as production of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and even pen ink. Much of the equipment and processes are also used in commercial enterprises.13 Developed countries with many diverse commercial chemical production plants could hide illicit production. Underdeveloped countries would attract more attention in their procurement processes through the types of raw materials they purchase or produce domestically. The types of plant facilities they import and assemble, such as high-quality, corrosion-resistant reactors, piping, and valves or sophisticated filtration systems may also attract attention. Still, supply-side nonproliferation is extremely difficult because of the dual uses of chemicals and equipment.

    What is the difference between unitary or binary weapons? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Chemical weapons may be unitary or binary in design. Unitary weapons are ready to use, but can be less stable and may have a shorter shelf life. Binary weapons have two separate component chemicals that are mixed just prior to launch to form a lethal agent. In advanced binary munitions, the two chemicals combine while the shell or warhead is en route to the target. Binary precursors are listed under Schedule 2 of the CWC, but the component chemicals of some binary chemical weapons may not be on any CWC schedule.

    How can one find a chemical plant? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    In the process of detecting CW production, there are two types of effluents released from a chemical plant: controlled smokestack emissions and &quot;fugitive&quot; emissions.15 Smokestack emissions are planned emissions from the production facility and would be filtered. Fugitive emissions are stray emissions in either production, testing, or storage and would be unintended. Chemical weapons production would be easier to detect through the unintended or accidental release of effluents since they would not be filtered or disguised and probably would be in greater concentration than planned emissions. However, essentially perfect timing would be required to catch fugitive emissions;

  </question>
  <passage>
    Security measures around Russian weapons facilities are poorly maintained, making insider theft or terrorist attack possible. The vulnerability of Russia's CW has been made plain in recent news headlines. In 1996, through an undercover sting operation, the Istanbul Security Directorate seized Russian-made mustard gas and sarin.10 According to the Istanbul newspaper, Hurriyet, detectives agreed to buy 20 tubes of CW agents from seller Emin Ekinci for $1 million. Ekinci arrived at the exchange carrying the tubes of nerve and blister agents in a plastic bag and was promptly arrested after the transaction. In his subsequent interrogation by police, Ekinci disclosed that he had acquired the mustard gas from a former KGB officer in Russia. Ekinci's deposition states that he was prepared to sell the containers to anyone who would pay for them. In 1997, Chechnyen terrorist leader Salman Raduyev declared his acquisition of Russian chemical weapons and made public threats to use them.11 More recently, the London Times has alleged that Hezbollah guerillas have attempted to purchase chemical and biological weapons from Eastern Europe.12 These purported cases of acquisition or diversion reinforce the chilling reality that terrorists have expressed a keen interest in securing chemical weaponry from the former Soviet Union, posing a real threat to US and international security.

    What does the DOD plan to do to secure Russia's cw stockpile? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    DOD's efforts to secure chemical weapons have focused on helping Russia build a facility to destroy its extensive nerve agent stockpile rather than securing the sites where its nerve agent is stored. However, the destruction facility will not be completed until 2006, and it could be another 40 years before Russia's stockpile would be completely destroyed. In 2001, DOD began helping Russia secure two sites that store nerve agent against external threats, which it estimates will be complete in fall 2003. DOD selected these two sites because they store nerve agent munitions that are small and easily portable. However, DOD has no plans to help secure three other Russian nerve agent storage sites that store 65 percent of Russia's declared nerve agent stockpile. DOD's decision to limit its work to two nerve agent sites leaves the issue of site security over the majority of Russia's nerve agent stockpile unresolved. In addition, even though Russia plans to move its nerve agent munitions by rail, in some cases hundreds of miles, to the destruction facility, Russia and DOD have not developed plans to secure the nerve agent while it is being transported. GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense reassess the need for improved security at chemical weapons sites and work with Russian officials to develop a plan to secure Russian chemical weapons during transit. GAO also suggests that Congress consider funding security improvements at the three remaining chemical weapons sites that have not received U.S. security assistance.

    The Russian government would also prefer to focus on destroying chemical weapons rather than securing chemical weapons sites. Although Russia has publicly stated it plans to destroy its declared chemical weapons stockpile by 2012, it will likely take much longer. As a result, a large quantity of chemical weapons in Russia will remain vulnerable to theft or diversion and pose a potential threat to U.S. national security interests. In addition, Russia will have to move most of its nerve agent several hundred miles by rail from current storage sites to the planned chemical weapons destruction facility. However, DOD and Russia have not begun discussions on the security that will be required for chemical munitions, as they are moved hundreds of miles from current storage sites to the planned chemical weapons destruction facility.

    DOD has limited information on the location and security of Russian sites with dangerous biological pathogens because the Russian government has provided limited access to and information about these sites. While DOD plans to address internal and external security threats at biological sites in Russia, it has no time frames for completing this work, and it has not determined how many biological sites in Russia should receive security improvements. After more than 4 years of effort, DOD has made little progress in addressing security concerns at these sites. As of December 2002, DOD had installed security equipment at two sites to protect against external security threats but had not addressed insider threats by increasing controls over access to materials or improving physical security within labs. U.S. efforts to secure biological sites in Russia have faced significant challenges. For example, the Russian government has closed many sites to U.S. security assistance programs, and the United States has been unable to negotiate an agreement with Russia that would expedite DOD's ability to provide security assistance.

    What are the internal security threats to Russia's biological sites? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Biological sites have unique characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to internal security threats, however. Experts have stated that there is a greater threat of potential proliferation of dangerous pathogens from insiders than from an outside attack because biological pathogens are small and can be smuggled out of a site without detection. According to a U.S. biosecurity expert, managers at Russian biological sites have been slow to acknowledge the potential of internal security threats. For example, officials at the Russian biological sites we visited stated that they knew their staff well and would notice if an individual posed a security threat because laboratory staff live and work in close quarters. These officials recognized the potential for insider security threats and said they would consider measures to mitigate these threats.

    reported that, as part of the Soviet bioweapons program, the anti-plague network helped identify new virulent strains of pathogens and participated in research on defensive measures. These facilities specialized in animal diseases that are communicable to man, such as plague, tularemia, anthrax, and cholera. According to DOD officials, the ministry was concerned that participation in Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs would be an admission that the antiplague centers had taken part in the Soviet biological weapons program. DOD also lacks access to four former Ministry of Defense biological weapons sites. These laboratories were involved in pathogen- and toxin-related research and maintained large pathogen collections. A major animal pathogen institute of the Ministry of Agriculture also remains closed to biosecurity assistance. DOD has made some progress in gaining access to one of the four Ministry of Defense facilities. In August 2002, U.S. Senator Richard Lugar was instrumental in initiating discussions with the management of the former Ministry of Defense facility, Kirov-200 (Strizhi), about potential collaborative research projects, according to a DOD official. The Russian government has nearly completed a transfer of ownership of the facility from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of Education. This institute's new civilian status is expected to enable future security projects with DOD.

  </question>
  <passage>
    Since the early 1990s, DOD has focused its nonproliferation efforts on the construction of a facility to destroy Russia's 40,000 metric ton stockpile of chemical weapons. Because construction of the facility was taking longer than expected, in fiscal year 2000, Congress directed DOD to develop additional plans to protect Russia's chemical weapons storage sites. DOD has since developed plans to address external threats at two chemical weapons sites that store nerve agent in small portable munitions. DOD plans to complete this work in fall 2003 but has no plans to extend the program to the five other sites, three of which store nerve agent and two that store blister agent. As a result, a large quantity of chemical weapons in Russia will remain vulnerable to theft or diversion.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),2 the implementing agency of the CWC, conducts inspections at chemical weapons facilities and reports its findings to member states, including the United States. OPCW regularly inspects Russia's chemical weapons stockpile. DOD has information concerning the quantity, location, and physical security conditions at Russia's declared chemical weapons storage sites and has plans to address external security at two sites. However, chemical weapons are stored at seven sites in Russia (see table 2). Five of these sites store nerve agent, which is considered the most dangerous form of chemical weapon.

  </question>
  <passage>
    Although somewhat constrained in the past by a lack of large funding sources and a limited number of scientists, South Africa's small but very active and highly skilled research community, together with years of experience with industrial processes such as fermentation, provide a solid foundation for future growth in the country's biotechnology capability. Recent government and private moves towards increasing support for this sector will enable South Africa to make further advances. The end of Apartheid and the installation of a new political dispensation also enabled more international collaboration. The most important factor in assessing South Africa's dual-use BW capability is the BW R&amp;D precedent set by Project Coast, which succeeded in sophisticated pathogen research and limited production. The above factors all combine to indicate that on a purely technical level, South Africa has the know-how, the equipment, and the raw materials to produce all that would be ! needed for at least a small-scale BW program. However, under current political conditions there is little or no will to do so -- indeed, the present government is vocal and active in its support of nonproliferation efforts

    Mid-1970s The Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) asks doctors and chemists from the University of Rhodesia to identify and test a range of chemical and biological agents that can be used as a &quot;fear factor&quot; in the war against nationalist guerrillas. Anatomy [Department] professor Dr. Robert Symington, head of the clinical program, recruits several colleagues and students to carry out the research. SADF Forensic Department experts and intelligence personnel have access to the most secret Rhodesian camps and likely play some part in the development of CBW agents, which include organophosphate poisons, thallium, warfarin [an anticoagulant rodenticide], anthrax bacteria, and other unspecified bacteriological agents. Symington later moves to South Africa and reportedly collaborates in the founding of a top secret South African CBW program (codenamed &quot;Red Mountain&quot;) prior to his death.

    1975-1 September 1978 The Selous Scouts set up a secret laboratory at the Andre Rabie barracks, to which three medical doctors from the regular Rhodesian Army are seconded. Large consignments of the denim clothing favored by guerrillas are purchased from middlemen and soaked in &quot;steel vats containing a solution of odourless and colourless poisons&quot; (probably organophosphates). Several prisoners are forcibly brought to the Mount Darwin Fort and apparently used as &quot;human guinea pigs&quot; to test the effects of the poison. The contaminated clothes are then supplied to guerrillas with the help of Reverend Arthur Kanodareki, a paid CIO agent, and somewhere between 67 and &quot;many hundreds&quot; of guerrillas then die after absorbing the poison through their skin. The program is terminated after the Special Branch (SB) commander learns of the deaths of innocent rural villagers to whom some of the poisoned clothes had been sold by unscrupulous local agents, agents who had been recruited by the Scouts and the Special! Branch and had been paid a Z1000 dollar bonus for each confirmed &quot;guerrilla&quot; death.

  </question>
  <passage>
    1975-1 September 1978 The Selous Scouts set up a secret laboratory at the Andre Rabie barracks, to which three medical doctors from the regular Rhodesian Army are seconded. Large consignments of the denim clothing favored by guerrillas are purchased from middlemen and soaked in &quot;steel vats containing a solution of odourless and colourless poisons&quot; (probably organophosphates). Several prisoners are forcibly brought to the Mount Darwin Fort and apparently used as &quot;human guinea pigs&quot; to test the effects of the poison. The contaminated clothes are then supplied to guerrillas with the help of Reverend Arthur Kanodareki, a paid CIO agent, and somewhere between 67 and &quot;many hundreds&quot; of guerrillas then die after absorbing the poison through their skin. The program is terminated after the Special Branch (SB) commander learns of the deaths of innocent rural villagers to whom some of the poisoned clothes had been sold by unscrupulous local agents, agents who had been recruited by the Scouts and the Special! Branch and had been paid a Z1000 dollar bonus for each confirmed &quot;guerrilla&quot; death. Symptoms of intoxication are that after seven days, the victims develop a fever and start to bleed from the nose and mouth. [Note: These symptoms are not consistent with most toxic organophosphate compounds, but could be due to warfarin. Fever is also sometimes present in thallium poisoning.]  -- Henrik Ellert, The Rhodesian Front War: Counter-Insurgency and Guerrilla War in Rhodesia, 1962-1980 (Gweru, Zimbabwe: Mambo Press, 1989), pp. 109-12; see also Jeremy Brickhill, &quot;Zimbabwe's Poisoned Legacy: Secret War in Southern Africa,&quot; Covert Action Quarterly 43 (Winter 1992-93), p. 8; Ken Flower, Serving Secretly: An Intelligence Chief on Record.

    1979 At a meeting between senior South African security force commanders and &quot;securocrats&quot; at Fort Klapperdorf, it is decided to enhance the effectiveness of the security forces by reorganizing them into units that would be more capable of disrupting ANC bases in neighboring countries. In a document entitled &quot;Institutions and Functions of the Special Forces,&quot; the State Security Council (SSC) concludes that SADF and SAP special operations units should be established that would &quot;not need to answer to Parliament, but only to the SSC.&quot; These were to be financed by secret funds, develop autonomous intelligence-gathering capabilities, and recruit their operatives from all ranks of the government. These decisions result in the establishment of the SAP's Koevoet unit and the reorganization of the Bureau of State Security's (BOSS) covert Z-Squads into the Delta 40 unit, which is tasked with &quot;monitoring certain external opponents of the regime with a view to their possible extinction.&quot; [No! te: The SADF's D40 unit soon after evolved into the Barnacle unit and eventually into the Civil Co-operation Bureau, whereas personnel from the SAP's Koevoet unit were later incorporated into the C(ounterinsurgency)1 section at the Vlakplaas base.]  -- Stephen Ellis, &quot;The Historical Significance of South Africa's Third Force,&quot; Journal of Southern African Studies 24:2 (June 1998), p. 271; Kevin A.

    January 1981 After SADF chief and Defence Council members meet with the Defense Minister to discuss security problems, the Defence Council orders military doctor Wouter Basson to travel abroad and secretly collect information about Western CBW programs that could be used as possible models for a South African CBW program. He is also instructed to make contacts with organizations that might provide information about the CBW capabilities of East Bloc countries. Upon his return, Basson reports that CBW programs in other countries are structured in such a way that &quot;offensive&quot; R&amp;D is conducted by civilian fronts up to the point of weaponization, after which actual weaponization takes place in top secret military laboratories.

    August 1981 During the course of &quot;Operation Protea&quot; in Angola, the SADF claims to discover evidence that the Cubans were preparing to use chemical weapons. Although these claims cannot be confirmed by outside investigators, Defence Minister Magnus Malan uses the resulting concern as a pretext to take SADF generals to Angola to study CBW protective suits in terms of clarifying the effects that wearing them will have on combat operations. Malan insists that the SADF take measures to force the Cubans to don protective suits [in order to inhibit their operational effectiveness], causing the SADF to adopt the deceptive tactic of using smoke [projectiles] to achieve this result. The SADF also claims to have evidence that some members of the ANC's military wing received training in CBW techniques in the Soviet Union.  -- Stephen Burgess and Helen Purkitt, The Rollback of South Africa's Biological Warfare Program (USAF Academy, Colorado: USAF Institute for National Security Studies, 2001), pp. 20 and 102, note 48, citing an interview with Malan.

Coetzee kidnaps them and takes them to a Security Police post on a farm at Kopfontein near the Botswana border. He obtains poison from General Neethling, head of the SAP Forensic Sciences Laboratory, and administers it in cans of cold beverages to the victims; Mavuso acts incoherently overnight but does not die. Two more attempts to administer poison to the two men are made at Groblersdal and Komatipoort, again without success. Finally, the men are sedated with soporifics administered in cold drinks, executed with a pistol by Captain Koos Vermeulen, and cremated.  -- Jacques Pauw, Into the Heart of Darkness: Confessions of Apartheid's Assassins (Johannesburg: Jonathan Ball, 1997), pp. 153-54; South Africa, Commission of Inquiry into Certain Alleged Murders, Report [of the Honourable Mr. Justice L.T.C.

    End of 1981 Defence Minister Malan officially approves the establishment of a CBW program, codenamed Project Coast, and makes funds available for that purpose. It is originally envisaged that the state-owned arms manufacturer ARMSCOR [Armaments Development and Production Corporation] will assist in the development of the program, but ARMSCOR officials advise Army Surgeon-General Nico J. Nieuwoudt that this task is &quot;too sensitive&quot; for the company. It is then decided that the SADF will have sole responsibility for the project, after which Malan and a &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; consisting of SADF chief Viljoen, SF head General A.

    1983 Basson allegedly provides Danie J. Phaal with a small bottle filled with a toxic substance at Waterkloof Air Base, and shows him how to administer it. Phaal then flies to Southwest Africa, adds the substance to a soft drink, and gives it to a SWAPO prisoner in a cell in Ondangwa. The following day, the man becomes extremely sick, and is flown to 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria. Basson later tells Phaal that the man died, but the latter suspects that this may have been a result of the administration of toxic substances by Basson himself.  -- Hooggeregshof, Die Staat teen Wouter Basson, Akte van Beskulding [Indictment] (1999), pp. 190, 228-29. 2-4 November 1983 Theron and Dr. J.

Beforehand, Bothma gives the prisoners Medazolam [a sedative whose trade name is Dormicum] mixed in cold sodas. The victims are then tied to a tree and smeared with the jellied substance. When it fails to kill them, Bothma provides Ketamine to Theron to give to the prisoners, then injects all three with Tubarine and Scoline.  -- Hooggeregshof, Die Staat teen Wouter Basson, Akte van Beskulding [Indictment] (1999), pp. 189, 227-28; Centre for Conflict Resolution, Basson Trial: Weekly Summaries of Court Proceedings, October 1999-April 2002, week 25, testimony of Kobus Bothma.

  </question>
  <passage>
    Mid-1980s Dr. Larry Ford, an American infectious disease specialist and CBW expert who had worked for the US government after graduating from high school, makes several trips to South Africa. In some cases he accompanies his American surgeon friend, Dr. Jerry Nilsson, an avowed white supremacist who had previously fought with the SAS during the Rhodesian civil war. Other trips are undertaken at the invitation of South African Army Surgeon-General Niel Knobel, who had befriended Ford due to their mutual interests in fertility drugs, AIDS prevention, and CBW. Ford later boasts on several occasions that he helped wiped out an entire village in Angola [presumably with BW or CW agents]. He also claims that he parachuted into southern Africa to take blood samples from dead guerrilla fighters in order to help the US government determine which BW agents the Soviets had vaccinated them against. [Note: It remains to be determined whether these last two claims are true.]  -- Stephen Burgess and Helen Purkitt, The Rollback of South Africa's Biological Warfare Program (USAF Academy, Colorado: USAF Institute for National Security Studies, 2001), pp. 35-6; Edward Humes, &quot;The Medicine Man,&quot; Los Angeles Magazine (July 2001), p. 167.

    What was the overall goal of South Africa's bioweapons program? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The most characteristic feature of the South African BW program was undoubtedly the development and utilization of a wide array of toxic agents to assassinate &quot;enemies of the state.&quot; There were two key precedents for this. One was the testing of lethal chemical agents on prisoners used as human guinea pigs by the Rhodesian Selous Scouts at their main barracks, and the subsequent use of those agents to contaminate denim clothing sold to nationalist guerrillas by various middlemen. This particular poisoning operation carried out during the Rhodesian civil war resulted in hundreds of deaths. The other was &quot;Operation Dual,&quot; a covert program whose purpose was to murder captured guerrillas that were uncooperative and South African military and police personnel that were considered security risks. This operation was initiated in 1979, two years before Project Coast was formally established.

    Scientists at RRL, in particular Dr. Mike Odendaal and Dr. James Davies, then prepared freeze-dried stocks of many of these toxic pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis, brucella bacteria, botulinum toxin, Vibrio cholerae, E-coli, HIV-infected blood, and salmonella bacteria. Snake venoms such as mamba toxin were also extracted and stockpiled. There were two types of potential &quot;delivery systems&quot; for these agents. First, Odendaal, Davies, and other RRL laboratory personnel purposely contaminated a considerable variety of foodstuffs and household items with them, such as soft-centered chocolates, lip balm, envelope flaps, deodorant, and cigarettes. According to both testimony and the notorious 1989 &quot;sales list&quot; (TRC document 52), several of these items were later passed on by RRL R&amp;D director Andre Immelman to members of SADF or SAP covert paramilitary units involved in assassination operations, whose operatives then delivered them to selected targets. After consuming or using them, the targeted individuals typically became very ill or died. Second, beginning in 1987 some of these substances may have also been intended for use with &quot;special applicators,&quot; arcane assassination devices designed by bioengineer Jan Lourens and prepared by his assistant Philip Morgan, a former Selous Scout and self-taught armorer, in the QB Lab at Systems Research and Development (SRD). Among these devices were rings, screwdrivers, walking sticks, and umbrellas that had been transformed into weapons by means of the addition of poison compartments and injectors or firing mechanisms for poisoned pellets. Although Basson later claimed that these devices were manufactured so that the SADF could develop defensive measures against them, on more than one occasion assassination plots seem to have been hatched that involved their projected use.

    One of the most worrisome aspects of the South African BW program was the efforts by RRL scientists to genetically engineer various biological agents. Alas, very few details about the specifics of this research have emerged so far, and it is therefore unclear just how many of these agents were actually produced. Such work was apparently carried out primarily by Odendaal, who among other things admitted that he had tried to develop antibiotic-resistant strains of anthrax bacteria.

These included all of the 45 local strains of anthrax bacteria, Brucella maletensis, all four types of Clostridium botulinum, cholera bacteria, and Yersinia enterocolitica or Y. pestis. Dr. Stiaan Wandrag of RRL later testified that his principal task was to develop CBW antidotes, ostensibly for the protection of VIPs, security force members, and South African agents who might be exposed to CW and BW agents, and that this work was carried out in the basement Compression Lab at RRL.  In the summer of 2002 Goosen, who was by then engaged in monitoring BW for South Africa's revamped National Intelligence Agency, was twice asked to provide Coast-related biological materials that had supposedly been destroyed to foreign parties. In the first such instance, he willingly provided a 5ml sample of goat serum used as an anthrax diagnostic agent for livestock and a 2ml sample of freeze-dried E. coli that had been genetically modified with the gene coding for Clostridium perfringens toxin to a shadowy American named Robert A. Zlokie, who was a US intelligence operative. Goosen later admitted that the reason he supplied Zlokie with this latter item was that he wanted to make the Americans, with whom he wished to collaborate, aware of just how sophisticated the genetic engineering potential of Project Coast had been.

    How did South African agents plan to use HIV/AIDS as a bioweapon? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    According to Basson, an AIDS research project had been authorized by Coast's Co-ordinating Management Committee (CMC) as part of a study to determine &quot;whether AIDS alone would allow the SADF to win the war.&quot; One of the doctors under his command, Graeme Gibson, was thus instructed to take secret blood samples from members of various guerrilla and military forces in Zimbabwe, Angola, and Mozambique so that their blood could be tested for HIV and the rate of infection could then be extrapolated. Their hope appears to have been that the rapid spread of HIV might seriously erode the numerical strength of hostile African armies and, by extension, slow the growth of the entire black population. In this connection it should be mentioned that American doctor Larry Ford also claimed to have collected blood samples from dead guerrillas in southern Africa. He was also working to develop a vaginal suppository called &quot;Inner Confidence&quot; that he hoped would protect women against HIV infection, a microbicide that he apparently tested on unwitting black prostitutes in southern Africa. Army Surgeon-General Niel Knobel, head of the CMC, seems to have made this possible by helping his friend and contract CBW advisor Ford obtain official approval to use the products made by Ford's company, Biofem, in South Africa. Unfortunately, many central aspects of Coast's AIDS project still remain to be clarified.

  <passage>
    Unlike the remnants of its chemical weapons program, South Africa's primary biological weapons facility, Roodeplaat Research Laboratories, was dismantled when the program came to an end.[3] However, several peripheral Project Coast facilities (mainly educational institutes that were used only partially for BW research) are still operating. Examples are the Pretoria Biomedical Center (formerly the H. A. Grove Laboratory) and the aforementioned Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (which has divisions such as bacteriology, applied biotechnology and toxicology). While these facilities have only participated in legitimate research since the termination of Project Coast, it can be assumed that they retain the latent capabilities that made them useful for Project Coast's purposes in the first place. Other South African organizations with a strong capability in biotechnology include the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the South African Medical Research Council, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, and various universities.

  </question>
  <passage>
    The biological component of South Africa's secret CBW program, Project Coast, was involved in several distinct but interrelated activities: the development and testing of lethal biological agents and their subsequent utilization as assassination weapons, the genetic engineering of certain biological agents, the carrying out of research projects on both African fertility and HIV transmission, and the cultivation and freeze-drying of larger than normal quantities of standard BW agents. Although there was never any large-scale attempt to weaponize such agents for battlefield use, at least two of them were allegedly deployed against segments of the population in neighboring states. All of these activities were undertaken by the apartheid-era regime, and have since been discontinued in conformity with the BTWC.

    To make the plant even more difficult to attack, Libya reportedly obtained blueprints used by the former Soviet Union to build underground bomb shelters.42 Apparently, only a direct hit on the top of the mountain with a nuclear warhead would be capable of destroying the facility. Libya purchased 60-ton rotary boring machines used to tunnel into the mountain from the German company Westfalia-Becorit. Subsequently, the Kohl government ordered the company to cease supplying spare parts for the boring machines, so as to render them useless.52 But Libya has managed to circumvent the embargo by obtaining spare parts from other companies in China, India, and Southeast Asia.53 The Belgian company Hassco, based in Ostend, supplied CW precursor chemicals to Jowfe. Among them were ethylene oxide, used for manufacturing mustard gas and incendiary bombs, and dimethylamine, a component of tabun nerve gas.54 South Africa may have supplied additional chemicals used in manufacturing chemical weapons

    When did South Africa abandon its program to deliver chemical weapons by missiles? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    South African President F.W. de Klerk issues a statement announcing South Africa's termination of its SLV program, the result of an investigation into the commercial viability of the South African commercial space industry by Denel. Foreign Minister Roelof Botha refuses to divulge the total amount spent on the project and claims that Denel's missile test site at Hangklip could be offered to foreign weapons manufacturers. Foreign Minister Pik Botha states that the decision has been made for commercial reasons. However, &quot;Western diplomats&quot; say heavy pressure from the United States was the deciding factor. Washington does not want the technology to fall under the control of a future African National Congress (ANC) government. A Western diplomatic source says, &quot;The bottom line is that the ANC has historically maintained close friendships with countries such as Libya, Cuba, and various Islamic revolutionary and fundamentalist Middle East states?[t]hese are regarded by Washington as unstable sponsors of terrorism who must not get access to South African missile technology.&quot; The envoys says South Africa was only about 12 months away from perfecting a rocket capable of propelling nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads more than 1,200 miles. ?Permanent Mission of South Africa to the United Nations, &quot;Space Industry in South Africa,&quot; 30 June 1993; &quot;South Africa abandons Independent Program,&quot; Reuters, 30 June 1993; &quot;South Africa to abandon missile launching programme,&quot; Agence France Presse, 30 June 1993,

    Why did South Africa start the chemical weapons program known as Project Coast? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    South Africa's biological weapons program was one of the two principal components of its covert state-sponsored CBW program, codenamed Project Coast (later Project Jota). Personnel associated with Coast have characterized it as the most sophisticated program of its type outside of the former Soviet Union, but international CBW experts generally consider it to have been considerably less advanced from a scientific standpoint. Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes, since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use?if not already using - CW agents against the South African Defence Force (SADF), from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities. The apartheid-era South African government viewed itself as the target of a &quot;total onslaught&quot; by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home, and to meet this all-encompassing &quot;red-black danger&quot; it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself. It was in this highly charged political and military context, which precipitated a &quot;bunker&quot; or &quot;laager&quot; mentality, that Coast was secretly initiated in 1981 under the aegis of the SADF Special Forces.

    On 11 April 2002, approximately seven months after the devastating terrorist attack launched by al-Q?`ida operatives on United States soil, a South African judge acquitted Dr. Wouter Basson, the Project Officer for the secret South African chemical and biological weapons (CBW) program, Project Coast, of all that remained of the 46 criminal charges originally filed against him by state prosecutors. Several years' worth of controversial, high-profile hearings and judicial inquiries thereby ended with a whimper rather than a bang, to the astonishment of most observers.[1] Unfortunately, the judge's decision not only ignored masses of evidence that appeared to link Basson to kidnappings and assassinations of so-called &quot;enemies of the state,&quot; but it also left many crucial questions about the possible proliferation of dangerous Project Coast materials and know-how to various unsavory regimes and non-state actors unanswered.

    In addition to the legitimate research conducted in South Africa to manage natural outbreaks of diseases caused by biological agents, in 1960 a company named Mechem was established as the Chemical Defence Unit (CDU) of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). It operated under the direction of Dr. J. P. De Villiers and the bureaucratic aegis of the Department of Trade and Industry, but was contracted solely by the SADF. Although the CDU was primarily responsible for investigating chemical compounds and coping with future CW dangers, it was also charged with monitoring the BW threat to South Africa. There are no indications that the CDU carried out research on BW agents, but De Villiers was apparently one of the first government scientists to cultivate a keen interest in the offensive potential of CW agents.[5]

    According to former Officer Commanding Counter Terrorist Operations M. J. McGuinness, the most senior Special Branch officer seconded to the CIO and the man who oversaw the CW program and other covert operations launched from the Selous Scouts fort at Bindura, 25-gallon drums of foul-smelling liquid were delivered to the base a dozen or so times in 1977. The chemicals were then poured into large sheets of tin and dried in the sun. When the liquid had dried, the leftover flakes were scooped up and pounded in a mortar with a pestle. The resulting powder was then brushed onto stocks of denim clothing favored by the guerrillas, mixed into processed meat such as bully beef before being repacked in new cans, or injected into bottles of alcohol with a micro-needle.[11]

    The SADF originally asked ARMSCOR to assist them in developing the South African CBW program, but ARMSCOR officials?who already had exclusive control over the country's nuclear program?refused to do so unless they were given full control. In the end the authorities decided to place the program solely under the control of the SADF. After returning from his travels overseas Basson had informed members of the Defence Command Council that foreign CBW programs utilized ostensibly &quot;civilian&quot; front companies to conduct all offensive R&amp;D up to the point of actual weaponization. Although this claim was not entirely accurate, the SADF nonetheless decided to create new front companies rather than use its own components or the existing structures under its control.[34]

    Who led South Africa's chemical weapons programs under Project Coast? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    In theory, the apex of the official chain of command for both the CW and BW components of Project Coast was the President of the Republic himself (P. W. Botha), who under the militarized National Security Management System (NSMS) established in August 1979 exercised his authority primarily through the State Security Council (SSC) rather than the Cabinet. Within this elaborate security-oriented and largely covert power structure, the SADF coordinated the activities of the various armed services (Army, Air Force, Navy, and ? later?both SAMS and the SF) through the Defence Command Council.[36]Indeed, Project Coast may well have had some sort of parallel, unofficial command structure that operated alongside the official CMC chain of command. Former Army Surgeon-General Niel Knobel claimed that Basson was often either doing things on his own initiative or, as Basson himself later acknowledged, being given operational instructions directly by other parties, including the Defence Minister, the head of the SADF, the Commanding Officer of the SF, the COS Intelligence, the Director-General of the NIS, the Commissioner of the SAP, and possibly also members of the SSC or Cabinet who he treated medically. After receiving at least some of his orders from these powerful figures, above all SADF generals A. J. &quot;Kat&quot; Liebenberg and Magnus Malan, Basson then passed instructions on?always verbally?to Project Coast scientists and select members of covert SADF or SAP units with a &quot;need to know,&quot; frequently without informing his nominal superiors on the CMC.

  </question>
  <passage>
    Nevertheless, from the point of view of transparency regarding prior South African CBW activities, it has unfortunately not been as forthcoming in releasing information as it might have been. First, both the American and British governments protested in 1994 and 1995 that South Africa's declarations in its Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) Confidence Building Measure were not credible because they downplayed the offensive features of the program. Second, the Form F portion of South Africa's 1995-2000 BTWC submissions, which specifically dealt with information about its past offensive and defensive R&amp;D programs, contained statements that Gould and Folb have characterized as &quot;incomplete&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot; insofar as they &quot;deliberately concealed relevant information about the programme.&quot;[62] Third, in May 1998 TRC commissioners were summoned to high-level meetings at the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Surgeon-General's office, and the NIS's successor, the revamped National Intelligence Agency (NIA), where they were pressured to prevent the public exposure of Project Coast on the grounds that embarrassing revelations might well interfere with South Africa's foreign relations. The TRC commissioners refused, but agreed to a process whereby sensitive documents could be identified by the authorities so that their dissemination could be restricted. Fourth, on 8 June 1998 the government unsuccessfully sought to persuade the TRC not to open its CBW hearings to the public.[63] Many of these actions were no doubt undertaken in good faith to prevent the release of sensitive scientific information that might lead to further proliferation or to facilitate the overall process of societal reconciliation, but in certain instances the new government seems to have sought to conceal portions of the historical record in order to forestall embarrassing revelations and/or protect various compromised but influential individuals.

    In the context of WMD proliferation, the most worrisome aspect of the now defunct Project Coast is that Basson, in connection with his overseas procurement activities, had established close contacts with foreign intelligence operatives and officials from &quot;rogue regimes&quot; such as Libya, with whom he is suspected of sharing information concerning CBW techniques or products.[66] Among his many alleged foreign interlocutors or collaborators were North American, European, and Taiwanese CBW experts he claims to have met at conferences; former British Army intelligence and Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) officer Roger Buffham; Swiss military intelligence chief Peter Regli and one of his operatives, J?rgen Jacomet; former Iranian government official, secret agent, and apparent con man Mohammed Ali Hashemi (the brother of Cyrus Hashemi of Iran-Contra Affair notoriety); senior Libyan intelligence officers Yusuf Murgham and `Abd al-Razaq; unscrupulous Croatian police and intelligence officials; Danish intelligence officer Hendrik Thomsen; and a Russian named Vorabyov. In addition, Basson spent several months in Libya supposedly working on designing a transportation system, claims to have traveled to Iraq to oversee the effects of CW attacks, claims to have gone to Iran to help the government deal with one or more outbreaks of disease, and visited Germany and Eastern Europe to consult with businessmen reputedly associated with the so-called &quot;CBW mafia,&quot; such as Hubert Bl?cher.[67] Other Project Coast scientists may also have made their way to countries with dictatorial regimes?on one occasion Immelman met in Johannesburg with an alleged Syrian military officer about CBW matters, but despite rumors to the contrary he never actually traveled to Syria.[68] Alas, even after more than ten years of investigations, various South African government agencies have been unable to clarify exactly what it was that Basson and his associates were up to overseas. Many knowledgeable observers fear, however, that he may have provided valuable technical information or perhaps even toxic materials generated by Project Coast to individuals and regimes with dubious credentials or unsavory agendas.

    Moreover, as recently as the summer of 2002, other Coast-linked personnel were approached by various foreign parties seeking to obtain CBW materials. On two occasions Dr. Daan Goosen, a former RRL scientist now engaged in monitoring BW for the NIA in South Africa, was asked to provide Coast-related biological materials that had supposedly been destroyed to foreign parties. In the first instance, he willingly provided a 5 ml sample of goat serum used as an anthrax diagnostic agent for livestock and a 2 ml sample of freeze-dried E. coli genetically modified with the gene coding for Clostridium perfringens toxin to a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer named Robert A. Zlokie and his handler Donald G. Mayes, an ex-US intelligence contract operative who spent years functioning as an &quot;independent&quot; arms dealer. The precise nature of the second prospective deal is less clear. According to some witnesses, Goosen was asked to provide anthrax and other BW agents to a group of &quot;Germans&quot; in exchange for 20 million dollars. He then became suspicious, and as soon as he learned that the &quot;Germans&quot; were really Arabs, including a Qatari who worked at the Saudi embassy, he opted out of the deal and told his NIA superiors.

    Though ostensibly a private company that did commercial contract work for industry, a &quot;cover&quot; which facilitated its recruitment of top scientists and its acquisition of materials overseas, RRL was in fact an SADF front company that worked primarily on &quot;hard&quot; (military) projects and only rarely (on average, about 10% of the time) on &quot;soft&quot; (commercial) or &quot;in-house&quot; (researcher-generated) projects. At its height RRL's staff numbered around 70, including 40 scientists and technicians, and was divided into several scientific departments?Toxicology, Molecular Biology, Organic Chemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, an Animal Unit, etc.?that were supported logistically by administrative, financial, and security departments. Its managing director was Dr. Daan Goosen (who was replaced in 1986 by Wynand Swanepoel), its R&amp;D director was Dr. Andre Immelman, its Animal Laboratory Services director was Dr. Schalk van Rensburg, and its administrative director was David Sparmer.

     If an organization of this sort actually exists, which remains to be substantiated, it may turn out that the American doctors Larry Ford and Jerry Nilsson, an outspoken white supremacist, were among its members. According to a pair of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informants, in the mid-1980s Dr. Ford transferred a suitcase full of dangerous &quot;kaffir-killing&quot; pathogens to Surgeon-General Knobel at the Los Angeles residence of the South African trade attache, Gideon Bouwer.[75] It has also emerged that Nilsson fought as a volunteer against nationalist guerrillas during the Rhodesian civil war, that Ford and Nilsson repeatedly visited South Africa, that Knobel consulted with Ford on CBW matters and personally introduced Ford to Basson, that Basson arranged to have secret accounts opened in Ford's name, and that at Knobel's request Ford lectured Coast scientists about the contamination of household items with biological agents.[76] In the wake of Ford's March 2000 suicide, which transpired just as he was beginning to be implicated in the attempted assassination of his Irvine business partner James Patrick Riley, the police discovered an arsenal of small arms and explosives, Christian Identity militia literature, and over 260 containers of biological materials on his various properties. (For unknown reasons, the FBI has yet to divulge the contents of all but 20 or so of those containers.)

    What was the impact of apartheid on South Africa's development of a chemical weapons program? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    South Africa's nuclear, biological, chemical, and missile programs reflected perceptions of internal and external threats stemming from its former government's policy of apartheid, as well as the country's advanced state of technical development. Pretoria developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles but relinquished these armaments in the early 1990s. The apartheid government also undertook a chemical and biological weapons (CBW) defense program, which reportedly also included offensive research and use of CBW agents against opponents of that government. While the proliferation legacies of South Africa's nuclear and missile programs were effectively resolved through verified disarmament measures that won international acclaim, dismantlement of the country's CBW capabilities was not verified to a comparable degree of certainty. The post-apartheid government of South Africa implemented its nonproliferation and disarmament policy through the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act (No. 87 of 1993) to control the transfer of sensitive items and technologies. South Africa is the first and, to date, only country to build a nuclear arsenal, and then voluntarily dismantle its entire nuclear weapons program. The South African experience demonstrates that at least under some conditions, unilateral disarmament is not only possible but can improve a nation?s security.

Principal Organs: Conference of the States Parties -- The Conference is the OPCW's principal organ, composed of representatives of all States Parties. A regular session of the Conference is to be held annually unless otherwise decided, and special sessions convened when necessary. The Conference can make decisions on any matters brought to its attention by the Executive Council or any of the States Parties. It elects members of the Executive Council and appoints the Director-General. The Conference is responsible for taking measures necessary to ensure compliance and for redressing situations of non-compliance. It has the power to suspend the rights and privileges of States Parties in non-compliance upon the recommendation of the Executive Council, and may recommend collective measures if a State Party engages in activities prohibited by the Convention. In cases of particular gravity, the Conference is to inform the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. The first session of the Conference of States Parties was held in The Hague, 6-23 May 1997, with the participation of 80 States Parties, 3 contracting States, and 34 signatory States.

    Did South Africa's Project Coast develop biological weapons as well as chemical weapons? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Project Coast, like the foreign CBW programs upon which it was said to have been modeled, included both a biological weapons component and a chemical weapons component. In contrast to their counterparts in certain other countries, however, the chemical and biological components were not completely separate in South Africa. Not only did they both have the same official chain of command, the same Project Officer, and integrated secret funding mechanisms, but the actual testing of certain chemical agents was sometimes carried out at the primary BW facility rather than at the facilities responsible for CW. Both the BW and CW programs in South Africa consisted of one principal production facility and a variety of other facilities that, for administrative, security, or technical reasons, carried out specialized research, testing, or production tasks. The BW program was centered at one large research, development, and production facility, Roodeplaat Research Laboratories (RRL), but it also apparently tapped the resources of several commercial firms, university laboratories, and even zoos in order to effectuate supplementary research and testing. After being privatized for a brief period in the early 1990s, the company was sold by its shareholders back to the government and then liquidated. A handful of key RRL personnel profited enormously from this privatization scheme, and several eventually found jobs at other biological or veterinary research facilities.

    Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes, since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use?if not already using - CW agents against the South African Defence Force (SADF), from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities. The apartheid-era South African government viewed itself as the target of a &quot;total onslaught&quot; by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home, and to meet this all-encompassing &quot;red-black danger&quot; it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself.

  </question>
  <passage>
    Second, on the eve of Zimbabwe's independence, many frustrated and soon-to-be-unemployed Rhodesian special operations personnel left their former homeland and moved to South Africa to continue their fight against &quot;terrorists.&quot; Under the rubric of &quot;Operation Winter,&quot; Rhodesian special force assets may have been covertly transferred en masse across the border. This operation was allegedly carried out with the connivance of British government ministers in Rhodesia, and effectuated in part by British and American transport planes. Among these assets were members of the Selous Scouts, the SAS, and the CIO, as well as their black collaborators and &quot;the poisoners and their poisons.&quot;[23] Whether or not such a mass covert transfer of assets took place, there is no doubt that many former Rhodesian special operators or scientists?e.g., Fritz Loots, Philip Morgan, and perhaps even Robert Symington?were subsequently incorporated directly into compatible South African units or institutions.[24] Hence there seem to have been various intimate, organic links between the Rhodesian and South African CBW programs, even though the precise role that Rhodesians may have played in the scientific or operational orientation of Project Coast remains to be clarified.

    How did Wouter Basson justify the creation of Project Coast? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Although it is likely that the looming collapse of Rhodesia and the escalation of the Angolan conflict between 1978 and 1980 altered SADF threat perceptions, most of the reports concerning this subject were prepared much later by Wouter Basson and his associates in order to justify the program's initiation retrospectively. The official line was that the program was created entirely for defensive purposes, since Marxist Movimento Popular de Liberta ao de Angola (MPLA: Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) and Cuban forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and perhaps planning to use?if they were not already using?chemical agents against the SADF.[25] It is true that Soviet-made vehicles used by Cuban forces that were captured in Angola were outfitted with chemical air filters, CW antidotes, and gas masks, and that rumors abounded about supposed MPLA use of CW agents against the troops of South Africa's allies, the Uniao Nacional para a Independ ncia Total de Angola (UNITA: National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), but this equipment was standard issue and the allegations about communist CW usage were never actually confirmed. Nevertheless, this provided the rationale, whether militarily justifiable or merely convenient, for the establishment of Coast.

    If Project Coast had really been initiated primarily in order to provide defensive CBW protection to SADF troops and their allies, all along its primary focus should have been on the purchase or manufacture of protective clothing and on the training of fighting troops to defend against CBW attacks. Yet this was never the case. According to Dr. Brian Davey, the scientist responsible for developing these defensive measures, even these most basic steps only began to be taken in 1986, and it was not until 1988 that the actual training of SADF troops to respond to CW commenced.

  <passage>
    At the time of &quot;Operation Modular&quot; in Angola in 1987, he said there were no NBC suits available to SADF troops in the field. Instead, the troops were told that in the event of a CW attack they should dig a foxhole, crawl in, and cover themselves with their ponchos, a wholly inadequate response. Even specialized medical units only had a total of 10-20 NBC suits at their disposal.[26] This is all the more astonishing given that a succession of companies owned by bioengineer Jan Lourens had by then succeeded in designing and manufacturing some of the world's best protective CBW equipment and clothing, stocks of which were already in great demand overseas. This gear had been successfully tested in the field using actual CBW agents rather than simulants, yet virtually none of it was being supplied to South African troops or their allies operating in neighboring states.[27] As Chandre Gould and Peter Folb rightly emphasize, such a lackluster reaction suggests that the SADF did not take the purported communist CBW threat all that seriously.

    Moreover, from the outset the South African CBW program also had offensive features and capabilities. This should come as no real surprise.

In a top secret November 1989 military report prepared by Basson on the privatization of Project Coast, he explicitly acknowledged the many offensive dimensions of the program. Among other things, he said that it was designed &quot;To conduct research with regard to basic aspects of chemical warfare (offensive)...To conduct research with regard to basic aspects of biological warfare (offensive)...To conduct research with regard to covert as well as conventional [delivery] systems...To establish an industrial capacity with regard to the production of offensive and defensive CBW equipment...[and] To give operational and technical CBW support (offensive and defensive)...&quot;[29] Note that these particular statements directly contradict his public testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and at his trial, during which he repeatedly stated that the project was defensive in orientation and denied that it had sponsored any offensive CBW actions. They also confirm the testimony of the many scientists who actually carried out research, testing, and production activities at the CW and BW facilities. Even though most of them had been recruited with the understanding that Coast was a defensive program, it soon became clear to them that it was in large part offensive.

    In early 1981 Defence Minister Constand Viljoen, who was reportedly very concerned about the threat posed by potential Cuban use of CW, ordered Basson to travel abroad and covertly collect information about Western CBW programs that might be used as a model for South Africa's own program. Basson was also instructed to make contact with people who could provide him with information on East Bloc programs. To this end he embarked on an international fact-finding mission, and in May 1981 attended an international CBW conference in San Antonio, Texas, and visited the Army Chemical School in Taiwan. In August 1981, after Basson had reported back to the Defence Command Council, Viljoen allocated funds for the completion of a feasibility study on the establishment of a South African CBW program. Toward the end of 1981, Defence Minister Magnus Malan approved the idea and authorized the release of funding for such a program.[31] Thus was born Project Coast, for which Basson was at once appointed Project Officer.

Although Basson modestly claimed that his function was to deal with the practical aspects of the project in accordance with the &quot;strategic guidelines&quot; provided by the CMC and its &quot;work groups,&quot; and always insisted that he did not have a &quot;free hand,&quot; his nominal superiors all concur that he personally supervised or managed the day-to-day affairs of the project, operated with a very high degree of autonomy and independence, and provided the CMC with the bulk of the crucial scientific and operational information that its members needed to make important managerial decisions, including the authorization of requested project expenditures.[38] In effect, the CMC seems to have become dependent upon Basson for its functioning, rather than the other way around. By the mid-1990s, when it became apparent that some portion of the funds requested by Basson had been used for his own personal gain rather than legitimate project needs, several of Basson's erstwhile supervisors complained that all along he had misled them or kept them in the dark about what he was really doing.

    How were South Africa's chemical weapons reportedly disposed of? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Unfortunately, there is no proof that the project's toxic materials and documents were all actually destroyed. Basson's reported destruction of Coast's CW and BW agents was never independently verified. On 29 January 1993 Basson told the CMC that he had disposed of several drums of the project's chemicals by flying them out over the ocean off Cape Agulhas in an Air Force plane and dumping them overboard, but it was not until 30 March 1993 that Commandant J. G. de Bruyn of the DMI prepared a report certifying this destruction or that Basson actually handed over the first samples that had supposedly been taken from the drums for chemical analysis by the SAP, as required. Indeed, during his cross-examination, Knobel admitted that he had simply taken Basson's word that these dangerous materials were destroyed.[59] Basson's claims to have overseen the burning up of Coast's biological agents in an oven at RRL were likewise never independently corroborated, and samples of some of the lethal agents produced at RRL or Delta G may have been removed from the former facility by certain scientists who worked there.[60] However that may be, there is no doubt whatsoever that hard copies of thousands of Delta G and RRL documents which had supposedly been recorded and destroyed were instead retained and stored in trunks by Basson. Nor was he alone in not handing over all of his Coast documentation for destruction. Scientists at RRL later admitted that they too had not turned over all their project reports, as instructed by RRL's management.[61] If nothing else, this demonstrates that the apartheid regime did not take adequate steps to ensure that its CBW program was dismantled in such a way as to prevent potential future proliferation.

    Who was entrusted with the destruction of Project Coast chemical weapons? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Despite this decision, in January 1993 Basson was entrusted with personally supervising the destruction of various Coast-related chemical stores, and earlier that same month he and other high-ranking SADF officers authorized the copying of all of the project's CBW technical and scientific information onto CD-ROMs, along with the subsequent destruction of the copied documents. This year-long task was carried out by Delta G chemist Klaus Psotta and Dr. Kobus Bothma at Data Images Information Systems, a company owned by Delta G's managing director Mijburgh (and previously known as Medchem Technologies). After the project documents were copied, thirteen discs full of classified data were placed in a succession of safes to which only De Klerk, Knobel, and the new Coast Project Officer, Colonel Ben Steyn, had keys.

    How did the South African government attempt to prevent Basson from assisting other regimes in developing chemical weapons after the dismantling of Project Coast? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    At the end of March 1993, the date he was to have been cashiered, Basson was re-employed by the government for one year to tie up other loose ends on the project. After this temporary extension of his work for Coast and a brief subsequent period of retirement from the SADF, in 1995 he was rehired as a physician at 1 Military Hospital in the hopes of forestalling his continued collaboration with unscrupulous foreign parties. In the meantime, the &quot;privatization&quot; of the project's military front companies and the reassignment of some of Coast's scientific personnel proceeded apace.

    On the verbal instructions of Basson, Andre Immelman secretly transferred a host of highly toxic chemicals and freeze-dried pathogens that had been produced either at Delta G or RRL?and thereafter stored in a refrigerator inside a fireproof and bombproof walk-in safe in his own office?to military and police personnel through various channels. The specific recipients of these lethal substances and contaminated items were Dr. R. F. Botha (alternately known as &quot;Koos&quot;, &quot;Mr. R&quot;, and &quot;Frans Brink&quot;) and Vernon Lange (otherwise known as &quot;Mr. T&quot; and &quot;Theo Otto&quot;), both of whom were operatives of the CCB; Chris Smit, Gert Otto, and Manie van Staden, three SB officers who either deployed some of them personally or later distributed them to C1/C10 &quot;hit team&quot; members; Johnny Koortzen, an ex-SO psychologist who in 1988 assumed control over Systems Research and Development, a company that bioengineer Jan Lourens had set up in part to manufacture special &quot;applicators,&quot; i.e., arcane assassination devices such as rings, screwdrivers, walking sticks, and umbrellas that had been transformed into weapons by means of the addition of poison compartments and injectors or firing mechanisms for poisoned pellets; and Basson himself. The actual substances included potentially lethal chemicals such as aldicarb, brodifacum, cantharidin, colchamine, cyanide, digoxin, methanol, monensin, paraoxon, paraquat, phencyclidine, phosphide, silatrane, sodium azide, thallium, and Vitamin D3, biological agents such as anthrax spores, botulinum toxin, brucella bacteria, salmonella bacteria, mamba venom, and bottles of cholera bacteria, and a wide variety of foodstuffs, beverages, household items, and cigarettes that had been contaminated with these poisons.[54] There can be little doubt that several of these toxic materials, items, or devices were subsequently used to murder or sicken opponents of the apartheid regime.

    In the context of WMD proliferation, the most worrisome aspect of the now defunct Project Coast is that Basson, in connection with his overseas procurement activities, had established close contacts with foreign intelligence operatives and officials from &quot;rogue regimes&quot; such as Libya, with whom he is suspected of sharing information concerning CBW techniques or products.[66] Among his many alleged foreign interlocutors or collaborators were North American, European, and Taiwanese CBW experts he claims to have met at conferences; former British Army intelligence and Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) officer Roger Buffham; Swiss military intelligence chief Peter Regli and one of his operatives, J?rgen Jacomet; former Iranian government official, secret agent, and apparent con man Mohammed Ali Hashemi (the brother of Cyrus Hashemi of Iran-Contra Affair notoriety); senior Libyan intelligence officers Yusuf Murgham and `Abd al-Razaq; unscrupulous Croatian police and intelligence officials; Danish intelligence officer Hendrik Thomsen; and a Russian named Vorabyov. In addition, Basson spent several months in Libya supposedly working on designing a transportation system, claims to have traveled to Iraq to oversee the effects of CW attacks, claims to have gone to Iran to help the government deal with one or more outbreaks of disease, and visited Germany and Eastern Europe to consult with businessmen reputedly associated with the so-called &quot;CBW mafia,&quot; such as Hubert Bl?cher.

    In both deals the middleman between Goosen and the &quot;foreigners&quot; was a right-winger and retired SADF Major-General associated with the CCB named Tai Minnaar, who in 1989 established a private company called Military Technical Services (MTS) that had links with the powerful South African mercenary recruitment agency Executive Outcomes (EO).[70] Shortly after the collapse of the second deal Minnaar suddenly died, officially of a heart attack. According to his girlfriend, however, his peculiar discoloration and bloating symptoms prior to death suggested that he may have been assassinated with some sort of poison, but this cannot be confirmed since relatives asked that his body be cremated and no autopsy was performed.[71] These two examples may represent only the tip of a much larger iceberg of secret efforts by foreigners to acquire South African CBW materials.

    What did South Africa feel it had to do to reintegrate itself back into the international community after apartheid? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    South Africa was trying to completely change course and reintegrate itself into international society. There were three things they realized they had to do: abolish apartheid, grant independence to Namibia, and join the Non-Proliferation Treaty. So as far as our nuclear strategy goes, everything just sort of fell into our lap after a decade of quiet -- and not so quiet -- influence.

    What were some of the dominant factors influencing the US-South African relationship during the 1980s? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    In South Africa this meant building a quiet alliance with the government and providing anti-Soviet military support. We softened up on our anti-apartheid stance. In the nuclear area, I believe we facilitated and even encouraged European suppliers to provide the Koeberg reactors with fuel which we couldn't supply under American law. Throughout the 1980s the dominant factor in US-South African relations was East-West, American-Soviet issues.  Throughout the 1980s the dominant factor in US-South African relations was East-West, American-Soviet issues. The Reagan Administration's regional strategy was called &quot;constructive engagement,&quot; which was mainly a military strategy against the Soviet threat. Eventually, by the end of the Reagan Administration, this strategy had actually worked. The Soviets had become over-extended and were pulling back, compromising in Afghanistan and southern Africa. Simultaneous with the Reagan pro-South African policy was a congressionally-mandated anti-South Africa, anti-apartheid policy that led to the imposition of increasingly tough sanctions in the late 1980s. Eventually, the pinch of sanctions and the end of the Soviet threat after 1989 led to a major change in South Africa. The South Africans themselves had gotten fed up with being isolated.

  </question>
  <passage>
    The South Africans claim to have taken such steps, but the situation is less reassuring in Brazil, since the civilian government's control over all aspects of the military's activities is not solid. (It was the Brazilian military that conduced the nuclear weapons program.) In fact, it seems that in Brazil all the specialists that were running the nuclear program are still there. In Argentina I don't see any problem. In Kazakhstan the new state is taking over the old Soviet Semipalatinsk test site and nuclear research center. This probably won't be a problem, but it does put all those assets in the hands of nuclear scientists who could potentially use them to some illicit purpose. South Africa also remains a concern, but at least the government recognizes its obligation to reassure outsiders that its nuclear teams have been reassigned.

    The Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) asks doctors and chemists from the University of Rhodesia to identify and test a range of chemical and biological agents that can be used as a &quot;fear factor&quot; in the war against nationalist guerrillas. Anatomy [Department] professor Dr. Robert Symington, head of the clinical program, recruits several colleagues and students to carry out the research. SADF Forensic Department experts and intelligence personnel have access to the most secret Rhodesian camps and likely play some part in the development of CBW agents, which include organophosphate poisons, thallium, warfarin [an anticoagulant rodenticide], anthrax bacteria, and other unspecified bacteriological agents. Symington later moves to South Africa and reportedly collaborates in the founding of a top secret South African CBW program (codenamed &quot;Red Mountain&quot;) prior to his death.

  <passage>
    The Selous Scouts set up a secret laboratory at the Andre Rabie barracks, to which three medical doctors from the regular Rhodesian Army are seconded. Large consignments of the denim clothing favored by guerrillas are purchased from middlemen and soaked in &quot;steel vats containing a solution of odourless and colourless poisons&quot; (probably organophosphates). Several prisoners are forcibly brought to the Mount Darwin Fort and apparently used as &quot;human guinea pigs&quot; to test the effects of the poison. Selous Scouts introduce &quot;measured quantities of bacteriological cultures&quot; at several points along the Ruya River in the wildlife area near the Mozambique border. This action corresponds with, and may have resulted in, a reported epidemic of deaths among people living on the river's banks. However, the cause of the epidemic was officially attributed to cholera. [Note: see also 1975-1980 entry above.] During a reconnaissance mission against guerrillas operating near the Cochemane administrative center in the Tete province, Selous Scouts observe that the town draws its water from a single reservoir and pour a &quot;lethal dose of poison&quot; into it. Rhodesian CIO intercepts confirm that 200 people suddenly die. [Note: The &quot;poison&quot; in question may be a reference to Vibrio cholerae, not a chemical agent. See 1975-1980 entry above.]

During its existence Coast scientists tested or developed a wide range of harmful BW agents, including Bacillus anthracis, botulinum toxin, Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium perfringens, plague bacteria, and salmonella bacteria. Some of these pathogens were probably used to assassinate individual &quot;enemies of the state,&quot; and it is alleged that both anthrax bacteria and V. cholerae were each employed on at least one occasion to infect larger populations.

    What kind of research was going on in South Africa before this project?

    There is no evidence that South Africa developed or produced BW agents of any type prior to the establishment of Project Coast, but by the early 1980s advanced research on many virulent biological pathogens had already been carried out for decades at several of the nation's leading medical, veterinary, and agricultural facilities.[2] This is hardly surprising, given the large number of diseases endemic to the country and the substantial role played by diverse animals and plants in South Africa's economy. Apart from clinical work performed at hospitals and animal facilities to treat or quarantine disease-stricken persons and animals, research on various lethal bacteria was carried out at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute and the H. A. Grove Research Centre at the University of Pretoria, whereas dangerous viruses were studied at the National Institute for Virology, the only facility in South Africa that contained a P-4 safety level biological laboratory.[3] Some of the scientists who worked at these facilities were later recruited to work at the principal Coast BW facility, Roodeplaat Research Laboratories (RRL), and a couple of these later testified that they had earlier done contract research for the South African Defence Force (SADF). Perhaps the most noteworthy case is that of Dr. Daan Goosen, who was working on a snake venom project for the South African Army at the H. A. Grove Centre when he was approached by Basson in 1983 and asked to turn over some mamba toxin so that a security threat could be eliminated.[4]

    On the purported instructions of Project Officer Wouter Basson, Immelman later secretly transferred anthrax bacteria and other highly toxic substances to military and police personnel through various channels. Some of these dangerous materials were provided to Dr. R. F. Botha (alternately known as &quot;Koos&quot;, &quot;Mr. R&quot;, and &quot;Frans Brink&quot;) and thence to Vernon Lange (otherwise known as &quot;Mr. T&quot; and &quot;Theo&quot;), both of whom were operatives of the Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB), a covert assassination unit operating under the aegis of the Special Forces (SF). Others were provided directly to Chris Smit, Gert Otto, and Manie van Staden, three Security Branch (SB) officers from the South African Police (SAP).

    What were Basson's responsibilities? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Operating under the control and direction of these &quot;work groups,&quot; at least in theory, was Project Officer Wouter Basson, who in January 1985 also began serving as the commander of 7 Medical Battalion Group, an elite SAMS team that provided medical support for SF units operating in the bush. As Project Officer, his appointed task was to act as an intermediary between the CMC and the directors and scientists at the various CBW facilities. Although Basson modestly claimed that his function was to deal with the practical aspects of the project in accordance with the &quot;strategic guidelines&quot; provided by the CMC and its &quot;work groups,&quot; and always insisted that he did not have a &quot;free hand,&quot; his nominal superiors all concur that he personally supervised or managed the day-to-day affairs of the project, operated with a very high degree of autonomy and independence, and provided the CMC with the bulk of the crucial scientific and operational information that its members needed to make important managerial decisions, including the authorization of requested project expenditures.

    In effect, the CMC seems to have become dependent upon Basson for its functioning, rather than the other way around. By the mid-1990s, when it became apparent that some portion of the funds requested by Basson had been used for his own personal gain rather than legitimate project needs, several of Basson's erstwhile supervisors complained that all along he had misled them or kept them in the dark about what he was really doing.

  <passage>
    Indeed, Project Coast may well have had some sort of parallel, unofficial command structure that operated alongside the official CMC chain of command. Former Army Surgeon-General Niel Knobel claimed that Basson was often either doing things on his own initiative or, as Basson himself later acknowledged, being given operational instructions directly by other parties, including the Defence Minister, the head of the SADF, the Commanding Officer of the SF, the COS Intelligence, the Director-General of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the Commissioner of the South African Police (SAP), and possibly also members of the SSC or Cabinet who he treated medically. After receiving at least some of his orders from these powerful figures, above all SADF generals A. J. &quot;Kat&quot; Liebenberg and Magnus Malan, Basson then passed instructions on -- always verbally -- to Project Coast scientists and select members of covert SADF or SAP units with a &quot;need to know,&quot; frequently without informing his nominal superiors on the CMC.

It was built specifically for this purpose on a farm 12-15 km north of Pretoria, near the Roodeplaat Dam, beginning in November 1983. By 1985 it consisted of a farmhouse, a small 3- or 4-room lab complex, and some animal cages, but it was thereafter expanded in phases to include a restricted P3-level basement Compression Lab and a security dog-breeding subsidiary (Roodeplaat Breeding Enterprises).

    What projects were going on at RRL? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Although RRL also did beneficial work on bovine vaccines, its efforts were focused on three types of military projects: 1) a toxin R&amp;D program headed by Immelman, whose purpose was to develop and test lethal BW and CW agents that were untraceable; 2) a fertility program, headed by Dr. Riana Borman, whose purpose may have been -- though this is bitterly debated, even by insiders -- to limit the growth of the black population; and 3) a BW program linked to new developments in the genetic engineering field, headed by Dr. Mike Odendaal, whose aim was to research and develop antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens by combining different agents. Although there was no large-scale weaponization of offensive BW agents at RRL, a plethora of toxic substances were acquired, tested, and/or prepared by scientists working for Immelman, whose own instructions came directly from Basson. Among these were BW agents like Bacillus anthracis, botulinum toxin, brucella bacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Escheria coli, Yersinia pestis and/or Y. enterocolitica, salmonella bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, HIV-infected blood, and snake venom, as well as CW agents like mustard, sarin, tabun, VX, and a wide array of other highly toxic chemicals. Some of RRL's products were then tested at the pyrotechnic labs at SF headquarters, the SAP's Forensic Sciences Laboratory, or other facilities at various state companies, semi-state companies, private companies, and universities.

    The most characteristic feature of the South African CBW program was undoubtedly the development, testing, and utilization of a wide array of hard-to-trace toxic agents to assassinate &quot;enemies of the state.&quot;[49] As insider testimony and the notorious RRL &quot;sales list&quot; of 1989 (TRC document 52) indicate, several of the highly toxic substances produced at both Delta G and RRL were actually deployed by clandestine SADF and SAP &quot;death squads,&quot; above all the SF's CCB and the SAP Security Branch's C[ounterinsurgency]1 section (later renamed C10) housed at the Vlakplaas base, in covert assassination operations.[50] In this context it should again be pointed out that members of various elite Rhodesian counterinsurgency units that had previously deployed toxic chemicals or biological agents against guerrillas during the Rhodesian civil war had thereafter been incorporated into SADF special operations units (like the SF and its D[elta]40 and Barnacle &quot;hit teams,&quot; the predecessors of the CCB) or the SAP's counterinsurgency forces (like the Koevoet [&quot;Crowbar&quot;] unit).[51]

As for the SADF, it was under the rubric of a plan initiated in 1979 and codenamed &quot;Operation Dual&quot; that a large number of targeted individuals -- guerrillas in neighboring countries, troublesome prisoners, untrustworthy members of the security forces, or activists in the African National Congress (ANC) and other South African opposition groups -- first began to be murdered in this fashion, and those who did not actually die sometimes suffered terrible illnesses or injuries. The primary SADF formation that carried out these &quot;Dual&quot; actions was the aforementioned Barnacle unit.

Consisting of representatives from the SAP's SB, the Division of Military Intelligence (DMI), the SF, and the NIS, one of its primary purposes was to &quot;identify human targets for removal&quot; in a series of monthly reports that were forwarded to the SSC. During the period it was operating, TREWITS authorized a total of 82 extra-judicial killings and 7 attempted killings.[53] The specific groups entrusted with carrying out these &quot;hits&quot; were the covert CCB and C1/C10 paramilitary units.

During the course of this trial, as well as at the hearings held by the TRC, a wealth of detailed information emerged regarding the true scope and nature of South Africa's CBW program. In April 2002 Basson was acquitted of all the charges filed against him, and disillusioned government prosecutors now appear to have abandoned their plans to file an appeal for a new trial.

In addition, Basson spent several months in Libya supposedly working on designing a transportation system, claims to have traveled to Iraq to oversee the effects of CW attacks, claims to have gone to Iran to help the government deal with one or more outbreaks of disease, and visited Germany and Eastern Europe to consult with businessmen reputedly associated with the so-called &quot;CBW mafia,&quot; such as Hubert Bl?cher.

    There is also some evidence indicating that Stephen J.

Although Hatfill's activities in southern Africa have yet to be fully clarified, it is known that he worked for the Rhodesian police's Special Branch and that he later obtained his medical degree from the University of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe.[78] Some have hinted that he operated out of the Selous Scouts base at the Bindura Fort, from whence McGuinness facilitated the launching of &quot;black operations,&quot; including CW actions. At present, however, intimations that Hatfill may have been personally involved in the covert dissemination of CW or BW agents in southern Africa can only be characterized as unsubstantiated. Be that as it may, in 2002 the South African media reported that Hatfill had earlier helped to train the Aquila Brigade shock troops of Eugene Terre'Blanche's right-wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB: Afrikaner Resistance Movement).[79] During this period, he also claims to have received advanced medical training from various SAMS components, as well as to have been assigned to its 2 Medical Battalion Group.

    South Africa signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1993, ratified the treaty in 1995, and is a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Executive Council. Grenades, artillery rounds, and mortar shells filled with tear gas by the apartheid government were subsequently destroyed prior to the 1997 entry-into-force of the CWC, and declared to the OPCW. Upon signing the CWC, South African declared that all CW munitions from Project Coast had been destroyed, but nongovernmental sources question whether the government had successfully disposed of all CW agents.

    Investigators suspect that Ford's possession of the toxic material may have been linked to his involvement in the South African biological weapons program. The South African Defense Force confirmed that Ford indeed served as an &quot;informal consultant.&quot;[F] Ford was introduced to the South African program in the 1980s through Dr. Neil Knobel, who at the time oversaw a portion of &quot;Project Coast,&quot; South Africa's covert biological weapons program. The program was directed by Dr. Wouter Basson, nicknamed &quot;Dr. Death,&quot; who is currently on trial for his illegal production of biological and chemical weapons.[G] Unconfirmed allegations also connect Ford to the U.S. government's chemical weapons program.[F]

    Investigations into Ford's relationship with Dr. Wouter Basson, the director of Project Coast, the former South African covert biological warfare program, suggest that Ford's AIDS research in South Africa was a ruse for work with this program.[D,E] In the late 1990's Ford was working on an anti-balding agent called silatrane, which was mentioned in the trial of Dr. Wouter Basson as a possible toxic agent.[G] Ford purchased farming enterprises for what Basson called the &quot;principals&quot; of the &quot;CBW mafia&quot; group, Abdul Razak, Dieter Dreier, and Vorobyov. These enterprises gave the principals access to chemicals, cultures, conferences, and diseases.[H] Ford demonstrated to scientists from Project Coast how to plant poisons in teabags and doilies. He allegedly sent scientists 5 bags of material which could be cultivated into organisms that could be used to kill anti-apartheid activitsts or those in anti-apartheid organizations, such as the African National Congress (ANC).[I] Ford may have illegally tested Biofem products, such as the female contraceptive, on South African prostitutes.[J]

    In theory, the apex of the official chain of command for both the BW and CW components of Project Coast was the President of the Republic himself (P. W. Botha), who under the militarized National Security Management System (NSMS) established in August 1979 exercised his authority primarily through the State Security Council (SSC) rather than the Cabinet. Within this elaborate security-oriented and largely covert power structure, the SADF coordinated the activities of the various armed services (Army, Air Force, Navy, and -- later -- both the South African Medical Services [SAMS] and the Special Forces [SF]) through a body known as the Defence Command Council. However, although administratively subordinate to this latter body, the entity that officially managed Project Coast was known as the Co-ordinating Management Committee (CMC), which typically met two to four times per year and normally comprised the SADF chief, the Army Surgeon-General (who was also the head of SAMS),! the Chief of Staff (COS) Intelligence, the COS Finance, representatives from the state armaments corporation ARMSCOR, personnel from the Auditor-General's office, and the Project Officer, who served as CMC secretary.

    What kind of Biological Warfare Activities in South Africa before Project Coast ? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    There is no evidence that South Africa developed or produced BW agents of any type prior to the establishment of Project Coast, but by the early 1980s advanced research on many virulent biological pathogens had already been carried out for decades at several of the nation's leading medical, veterinary, and agricultural facilities.[2] This is hardly surprising, given the large number of diseases endemic to the country and the substantial role played by diverse animals and plants in South Africa's economy. Apart from clinical work performed at hospitals and animal facilities to treat or quarantine disease-stricken persons and animals, research on various lethal bacteria was carried out at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute and the H. A. Grove Research Centre at the University of Pretoria, whereas dangerous viruses were studied at the National Institute for Virology, the only facility in South Africa that contained a P-4 safety level biological laboratory.[3] Some o! f the scientists who worked at these facilities were later recruited to work at the principal Coast BW facility, Roodeplaat Research Laboratories (RRL), and a couple of these later testified that they had earlier done contract research for the South African Defence Force (SADF). Perhaps the most noteworthy case is that of Dr. Daan Goosen, who was working on a snake venom project for the South African Army at the H. A. Grove Centre when he was approached by Basson in 1983 and asked to turn over some mamba toxin so that a security threat could be eliminated

  <passage>
    The SADF provided funding to the Project Coast front companies through various &quot;private&quot; bank accounts that had been set up explicitly for such purposes. The COS Finance was primarily responsible for arranging the details of the transfer of funds after the requested amounts were approved by the CMC. Most of the funds were transferred from the SADF's Secret Defence Fund directly to Infladel, another SADF front company that in addition to disbursing funds was responsible for the technical information system, the operational coordination of the program, and the security and safety systems of Delta G and RRL. In 1990 Infladel was dissolved and its functions were transferred to two new companies, Sefmed Information Services and D. John Truter Financial Consultants.[42] According to Hennie Bruwer, the Office of Serious Economic Offenses (OSEO) auditor who conducted a ten-year investigation of Basson's financial transactions, a total of around 418 million rand were allocate! d to the CBW program in the period between 1 April 1983 and 28 February 1992. From 1 March 1987 to 28 February 1993, the period covered by the Basson indictment, the project had access to nearly 340 million rand, of which 37 million rand were allegedly misappropriated by Basson and his collaborators.[43] These individuals set up an elaborate network of front companies and secret accounts in various parts of the world, through which SADF money could be funneled to procure embargoed materials, set up businesses, pay foreign collaborators, and bribe foreign officials in order to facilitate the transfer of materials and equipment to South Africa. All in all, Project Coast cost the SADF a total of 418,226,509 rand, of which 98,432,657 were expended on RRL and 127,467,406 were expended on Delta G.[44]

    What were the Biological Weapons used and produced by South Africa ? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Although Project Coast did not sponsor any large-scale production or weaponization of standard biological warfare agents, several such agents were produced and tested at RRL. These included all of the 45 local strains of anthrax bacteria, Brucella maletensis, all four types of Clostridium botulinum, cholera bacteria, and Yersinia enterocolitica and/or Y. pestis.[45] Dr. Stiaan Wandrag of RRL later testified that his principal task was to develop CBW antidotes, ostensibly for the protection of VIPs, security force members, and South African agents who might be exposed to CW and BW agents, and that this work was carried out in the basement Compression Lab at RRL. Nevertheless, in declaring that all research on lethal CBW agents intended for conventional weapons delivery had been concluded by 1986 or 1987, Basson tacitly acknowledged that early on the South Africans may have considered employing biological agents as offensive battlefield or &quot;area denial&quot; weapons.[46] Gi! ven the Rhodesian precedent, it is perhaps not surprising that the South African security forces were themselves later accused of participating in offensive BW attacks. First, some observers have attributed the so-called &quot;anthrax epizootic&quot; that broke out in various areas of Zimbabwe in 1979 and 1980 -- prior, it should be noted, to the official establishment of Project Coast -- to the intentional dissemination of B. anthracis by Rhodesian and/or South African special operations personnel. However, teams of international scientists who subsequently investigated the incident were unable to determine whether this outbreak was natural or man-made.[47] Second, in August of 1989 Basson reportedly instructed RRL's R&amp;D director Andre Immelman to provide 22 bottles of V. cholerae to Dr. R. J. Botha, at the time a medical coordinator of the Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB), a covert SF assassination unit. CCB deputy chief Joe Verster then provided four of those bottles to regional CCB comma! nder Pieter Botes, who testified that he directed his subordinates Charlie Krause and Jose Daniels to dump the contents of two of them into the water supply at the Southwest Africa Peoples Organisation (SWAPO) refugee camp outside Windhoek in Namibia. In the end, this operation failed to produce the desired contamination effect because of the high chlorine content of the water.[48] There are no other indications that biological weapons were used by South Africa in offensive actions of this type.

According to RRL lab director Schalk van Rensburg, &quot;[t]he most frequent instruction we obtained from Doctor Basson and Doctor Swanepoel was to develop something with which you could kill an individual which would make his death resemble a natural death, and that something was to be not detectable in a normal forensic laboratory.&quot; See Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), Hearings on South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme, testimony of Van Rensburg.

  </question>
  <passage>
    In February 2003, towards the end of a long period of bitter international diplomatic wrangling over the best way to disarm the Ba`th regime of Saddam Husayn in Iraq, the South African government sent a delegation to Baghdad with great fanfare to advise the Iraqis on how best to proceed with a verifiable process of WMD disarmament. In doing so, the South Africans were seeking greater world recognition and presenting their own disarmament process as a model for future Iraqi disarmament.[65] Yet however justifiable South Africa's pride may have been in regard to the dismantling of its nuclear program, such pride would have been largely misplaced had it been extended to the dismantling of the country's CBW program. Not only did many irregularities mark South Africa's rather convoluted CBW disarmament process, not the least of which was the lack of any independent verification of the alleged destruction of its remaining stocks of chemical and biological agents, but there! are indications that certain key personnel associated with Project Coast may have subsequently facilitated CBW proliferation, intentionally or otherwise.

    What is the evidence that Project Coast Personnel have been contacted for CBW materials ? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    Coast-linked personnel were approached by various foreign parties seeking to obtain CBW materials. On two occasions Dr. Daan Goosen, a former RRL scientist now engaged in monitoring BW for the NIA in South Africa, was asked to provide Coast-related biological materials that had supposedly been destroyed to foreign parties. In the first instance, he willingly provided a 5 ml sample of goat serum used as an anthrax diagnostic agent for livestock and a 2 ml sample of freeze-dried E. coli genetically modified with the gene coding for Clostridium perfringens toxin to a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer named Robert A. Zlokie and his handler Donald G. Mayes, an ex-US intelligence contract operative who spent years functioning as an &quot;independent&quot; arms dealer. The precise nature of the second prospective deal is less clear. According to some witnesses, Goosen was asked to provide anthrax and other BW agents to a group of &quot;Germans&quot; in exchange for 20 million do! llars. He then became suspicious, and as soon as he learned that the &quot;Germans&quot; were really Arabs, including a Qatari who worked at the Saudi embassy, he opted out of the deal and told his NIA superiors. According to other sources, Goosen was the target of an SAP &quot;sting&quot; operation. A phony &quot;shaykh&quot; approached him and offered to pay him 150 million dollars for samples of anthrax and the aforementioned serum, as well as other items. Goosen was unwilling to provide such materials to Arabs, who he feared might endeavor to use them in acts of terrorism, and therefore reported the incident to the NIA. At the moment, this latter version appears to be more accurate.[69] In both deals the middleman between Goosen and the &quot;foreigners&quot; was a right-winger and retired SADF Major-General associated with the CCB named Tai Minnaar, who in 1989 established a private company called Military Technical Services (MTS) that had links with the powerful South African mercenary recruitment agency Exe! cutive Outcomes (EO).[70] Shortly after the collapse of the second deal Minnaar suddenly died, officially of a heart attack.

    In the context of WMD proliferation, the most worrisome aspect of the now defunct Project Coast is that Basson, in connection with his overseas procurement activities, had established close contacts with foreign intelligence operatives and officials from &quot;rogue regimes&quot; such as Libya, with whom he is suspected of sharing information concerning CBW techniques or products.[66] Among his many alleged foreign interlocutors or collaborators were North American, European, and Taiwanese CBW experts he claims to have met at conferences; former British Army intelligence and Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) officer Roger Buffham; Swiss military intelligence chief Peter Regli and one of his operatives, J?rgen Jacomet; former Iranian government official, secret agent, and apparent con man Mohammed Ali Hashemi (the brother of Cyrus Hashemi of Iran-Contra Affair notoriety); senior Libyan intelligence officers Yusuf Murgham and `Abd al-Razaq; unscrupulous Croatian police and intel! ligence officials; Danish intelligence officer Hendrik Thomsen; and a Russian named Vorabyov. In addition, Basson spent several months in Libya supposedly working on designing a transportation system, claims to have traveled to Iraq to oversee the effects of CW attacks, claims to have gone to Iran to help the government deal with one or more outbreaks of disease, and visited Germany and Eastern Europe to consult with businessmen reputedly associated with the so-called &quot;CBW mafia,&quot; such as Hubert Bl?cher.[67] Other Project Coast scientists may also have made their way to countries with dictatorial regimes -- on one occasion Immelman met in Johannesburg with an alleged Syrian military officer about CBW matters, but despite rumors to the contrary he never actually traveled to Syria.[68] Alas, even after more than ten years of investigations, various South African government agencies have been unable to clarify exactly what it was that Basson and his associates were up to overseas.! Many knowledgeable observers fear, however, that he may have provided valuable technical information or perhaps even toxic materials generated by Project Coast to individuals and regimes with dubious credentials or unsavory agendas.

    What are the different activities for which Project Coast was responsible ? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The biological component of South Africa's secret CBW program, Project Coast, was involved in several distinct but interrelated activities: the development and testing of lethal biological agents and their subsequent utilization as assassination weapons, the genetic engineering of certain biological agents, the carrying out of research projects on both African fertility and HIV transmission, and the cultivation and freeze-drying of larger than normal quantities of standard BW agents. Although there was never any large-scale attempt to weaponize such agents for battlefield use, at least two of them were allegedly deployed against segments of the population in neighboring states. All of these activities were undertaken by the apartheid-era regime, and have since been discontinued in conformity with the BTWC.

    Which programs were precendents to Project Coast ? 
  </question>
  <passage>
    The most characteristic feature of the South African BW program was undoubtedly the development and utilization of a wide array of toxic agents to assassinate &quot;enemies of the state.&quot; There were two key precedents for this. One was the testing of lethal chemical agents on prisoners used as human guinea pigs by the Rhodesian Selous Scouts at their main barracks, and the subsequent use of those agents to contaminate denim clothing sold to nationalist guerrillas by various middlemen. This particular poisoning operation carried out during the Rhodesian civil war resulted in hundreds of deaths. The other was &quot;Operation Dual,&quot; a covert program whose purpose was to murder captured guerrillas that were uncooperative and South African military and police personnel that were considered security risks.

    &quot;Operation Dual,&quot; a covert program whose purpose was to murder captured guerrillas that were uncooperative and South African military and police personnel that were considered security risks. This operation was initiated in 1979, two years before Project Coast was formally established. Lieutenant-General Fritz Loots, the very first chief of the fledgling Special Forces (SF), is said to have personally authorized the activation of this elimination program, and soon after also supposedly approved of a plan proposed by Johan Theron, a member of the South African Defence Force's (SADF) paramilitary Barnacle unit, whereby the victims would be secretly disposed of by being dropped from aircraft dozens of miles out over the ocean so that their bodies would never be found.

  <passage>
    Biotechnology research and development has taken place in South Africa for over 25 years. Since the late 1970s, GM (genetic modification) technology had been worked on in South Africa, although until relatively recently biotechnology remained a tiny focus. South Africa has nonetheless approved four GM crops for commercial release and in 2000 ranked fifth in the world in terms of area planted with transgenic crops (almost 200,000 hectares). Currently, approximately 110 groups from both academic and research institutions are involved in plant biotechnology. The medical/pharmaceutical sector is the most active in biotechnology research, with the majority of R&amp;D activities taking place at educational institutions, as opposed to private research facilities. Current medical projects include the development of treatments for AIDS and tuberculosis. There are also mature industries involved in brewing and food production.

    In the past, all sectors of industry were dependent on imported biotechnology; since, as is the case with most developing countries, government resources devoted to indigenous R&amp;D were limited by other exigencies and paled in comparison with those available in First World states. However, the government has recently decided to make biotechnology research and development a priority, a policy outlined in a National Biotechnology Strategy document in August 2001. There are now a variety of funding sources available for biotechnology, including private venture capital firms (such as Chrysalis Biotechnology), along with the recently announced establishment of government-funded Regional Innovation Centers. South Africa's investment in biotechnology companies grew from approximately R100 million in 1995-1997 to an estimated R200 million in 2001. There are also a number of national and international collaborative research programs.

  <passage>
    South Africa is the only country in Africa with a P4 (Physical Containment level 4) laboratory, known as the Special Pathogens Unit, at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases[1]. This facility was designed to handle extremely hazardous pathogens. At least one university is planning to build a P3 containment laboratory and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) runs a specialized containment laboratory for the study of agriculturally relevant organisms as part of its Exotic Diseases Division at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, working mainly with Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). South Africa also has the technology to develop and produce vaccines. For example, the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute has both a vaccine research and production capability and has developed vaccines for the prevention or control of several endemic diseases, including African horsesickness, botulism, anthrax, and FMD. The Institute also maintains an extensive bank of virus st! rains.  South Africa's research capabilities in the biological sciences include the identification and isolation of commercially important genes, industrial microbe and enzyme improvement strategies, single-cell protein research, as well as biotransformations in the area of materials and chemicals. South Africa also has high-level diagnostic tools available, such as electron microscopy, PCR, RNA sequencing, and monoclonal antibody technology. Kenochem, a South African company, produces anti-caking agents to facilitate the even distribution of fertilizer, a technology that could aid in the production of deliverable BW agents.

    Several dangerous pathogens are endemic to South Africa, and can thus be sourced from the environment with varying degrees of difficulty. Indigenously occurring organisms include Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic fever virus, Vibrio cholerae, and Salmonella typhi. South Africa was also the last country to officially destroy its stocks of smallpox virus in December 1983. Since it maintained a biological warfare program at the time, there is at least a slim possibility that not all stocks of the virus were destroyed, although no evidence has ever suggested the continued presence of smallpox in the country.

In the United States from 1915 to 1917 the program was operated by Anton Dilger, an American-born graduate of Johns Hopkins Medical School, who had brought cultures from Berlin and grew them in an improvised bacteriology laboratory in his suburban Washington, D.C., dwelling  . During the Korean War the Communist Bloc alleged that the United States had engaged in biologic warfare against North Korea and China using anthrax and other agents. The United States categorically denied these allegations and dismissed them as propaganda. Recent reevaluation by scholars, however, reveals that the Chinese leadership firmly believed the allegations then and continues to believe them today.
