<comment class="subsection"> 1.2 SYLLOGISTIC FALLACIES </comment>


<comment>
  The "Syllogism" article refers to the following article on syllogistic
  fallacies:
  
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogistic_fallacy
  
  which, in turn refers to the following specific fallacies:
  
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_conclusion_from_a_negative_premise
    (1) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_fallacy
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_exclusive_premises
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_undistributed_middle
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicit_major
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicit_minor
    (2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_necessity
    
    (1) was omitted because it gives no examples.  (2) was omitted because it
    relates to a modal syllogism.  Fallacies on "statistical" and "disjunctive"
    syllogisms were omitted because they do not fall within the syllogism
    proper.
