			<t_str doc="Animal">Animals are a major group of organisms, classified as the kingdom Animalia or Meta­zoa. In general they are multi­cellular, capable of locomotion, responsive to their environment, and feed by consuming other organisms. Their body plan becomes fixed as they develop, usually early on in their development as embryos, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on. More specifically, animals can be defined as heterotrophic eukaryotes without cell walls, which move through a blastula stage in early development[1].	</t_str>
