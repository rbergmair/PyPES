Crude oil prices shot to new highs yesterday as markets reacted to a threat by Russian authorities to shut down most of the production from that country's largest oil company.
Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.
There can be no doubt that the Administration already is weary of Aristide, a populist Roman Catholic priest who in December, 1990, won an overwhelming victory in Haiti's only democratic presidential election.
The program, financed with a grant from the UN Agency for International Development, is aimed at reducing infant mortality in Madagascar, an island nation in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
U.S. officials said they hope to install Aristide presidential palace in Port-au-Prince about 10 days after U.S. troops land in Haiti, a schedule that an Aristide aide said is acceptable to the ousted president.
