The American House of Representatives is due to vote today, on a resolution submitted by the Chairman of the Judicial Committee, Henry Hyde, asking Congress to launch an investigation over charges brought forward by Independent Prosecutor-General Kenneth Star against President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
The source added that the investigation proved that the bases of the genocide crime "were completed with a series of illegal arrests followed in some cases with assassinations or cases of disappearances and were preceded, according to information attached to the file, by cases of torture."
The Damascus public have been welcomed into the election candidate's private homes or to specially erected tents where voters have been enjoying food, drink and entertainment, particularly in the home of the wealthy candidate, Adnan Mullah, where dozens of supporters and friends have been invited to dinner every evening.
