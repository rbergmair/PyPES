Maza Marquez said that the fact that a payment is being offered for the capture of Pablo Escobar does not mean that other persons accused of being capos of the mafia are not being sought and that if anyone being held in connection with the investigation of the killing of Luis Carlos Galan is released, that does not mean that the investigations are not proceeding well.
The murders of Galan, a high-ranking police officer, and a judge last week, were probably carried out by an Israeli mercenary paid by the Medellin cartel - the world's most powerful drug-trafficking mafia - which has set up paramilitary squads accused of hundreds of individual murders and massacres against political and labor leaders, as well as peasants and patriotic union leftist militants in different parts of the country.
