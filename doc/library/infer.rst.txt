:mod:`pypes.infer` --- Inference Engines & Evaluation Environment
=================================================================

.. module:: pypes.infer
  :synopsis: provides routines for running the inference
     engines and using their output for evaluation purposes.

:mod:`pypes.infer` provides routines for running the inference
engines and using their output for evaluation purposes.


.. class:: InferenceAgent( [paramid] )

   is the base class for inference agents.

   .. attribute:: paramid

   .. method:: reset()
   .. method:: process_sentence( sentid, rec, text )
   .. method:: process_discourse( discid, rec, sents [ , inf=False ] )
   .. method:: preprocess()
   .. method:: infer( disc, antecedent, consequent )


.. class:: YesAgent( [paramid] )

      is a baseline :class:`pypes.infer.InferenceAgent` whose
      :meth:`infer` method always returns ( 1.0, 0.0 ).


.. class:: NoAgent( [paramid] )

      is a baseline :class:`pypes.infer.InferenceAgent` whose
      :meth:`infer` method always returns ( 0.0, 1.0 ).


.. class:: SemanticInferenceAgent( [paramid] )

   is an :class:`pypes.infer.InferenceAgent` which serves as a base
   class for inference agents which work with semantic representations
   from the item bank.  It implements :meth:`reset`,
   :meth:`process_sentence`, :meth:`process_discourse`, and
   :meth:`preprocess`, in such a way that only the :meth:`infer`
   method remains to be implemented by the writer of the specific
   semantic inference agent.

   .. attribute:: pfs
   .. attribute:: discs

   The attributes :attr:`pfs` and :attr:`discs` are populated
   so that, within the :meth:`infer` method they are available as
   mappings, mapping sentence ids to protoforms, and discourse ids
   to lists of sentence ids, respectively.
   


.. class:: TestsuiteRunner( [ ( tsdirname, tsitemsdbdirname ) ] )

   .. method:: add_agent( agent )
   .. method:: run()


.. class:: run_testsuite( tsdirnameprefix, tsitemsdbdirname )

   is a synonym of :meth:`bin.run_testsuite`; controls an iteration
   through the directories which have *tsdirnameprefix* as a prefix.
   Within this iteration, it instantiates the :class:`TestsuiteRunner`,
   calls :meth:`TestsuiteRunner.add_agent` for all of the above agents,
   and then calls :meth:`TestsuiteRunner.run`.
