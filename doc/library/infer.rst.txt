:mod:`pypes.infer` --- Inference Engines & Evaluation Environment
=================================================================

.. module:: pypes.infer
  :synopsis: provides routines for running the inference
     engines and using their output for evaluation purposes.

:mod:`pypes.infer` provides routines for running the inference
engines and using their output for evaluation purposes.


.. class:: InferenceAgent( [paramid] )

   is the base class for inference agents.

   .. attribute:: paramid

   .. method:: reset()
   .. method:: process_sentence( sentid, rec, text )
   .. method:: process_discourse( discid, rec, sents [ , inf=False ] )
   .. method:: preprocess()
   .. method:: infer( disc, antecedent, consequent )


.. class:: YesAgent( [paramid] )

   (see also: :class:`InferenceAgent`)

   is a baseline :class:`InferenceAgent` class whose
   :meth:`infer` method always returns ``( 1.0, 0.0 )``.


.. class:: NoAgent( [paramid] )

   (see also: :class:`InferenceAgent`)

   is a baseline :class:`InferenceAgent` class whose
   :meth:`infer` method always returns ``( 0.0, 1.0 )``.


.. class:: SemanticInferenceAgent( [paramid] )

   (see also: :class:`InferenceAgent`)

   is a subclass of :class:`InferenceAgent` and serves as base class
   for inference agents which work with semantic representations from
   the item bank.
   
   It implements :meth:`reset`,
   :meth:`process_sentence`, :meth:`process_discourse`, and
   :meth:`preprocess` to collect the appropriate protoforms
   from the itembank.

   .. attribute:: pfs
   .. attribute:: discs

   The attributes :attr:`pfs` and :attr:`discs` are populated
   so that, within the :meth:`infer` method they are available as
   mappings, mapping sentence ids to protoforms, and discourse ids
   to lists of sentence ids, respectively.


   .. method:: infer( disc, antecedent, consequent )

      (see also: :meth:`InferenceAgent.infer`)

      You will need to override this to implement your own
      inference agent.


.. class:: TestsuiteRunner( [ ( tsdirname, tsitemsdbdirname ) ] )

   .. method:: add_agent( agent )
   .. method:: run()


.. function:: run_testsuite( tsdirnameprefix, tsitemsdbdirname )

   (see also: :meth:`pypes.bin.run_testsuite`)

   is a synonym of :func:`pypes.bin.run_testsuite`; controls an iteration
   through the directories which have *tsdirnameprefix* as a prefix.
   Within this iteration, it instantiates the :class:`TestsuiteRunner`,
   calls :meth:`TestsuiteRunner.add_agent` for all of the above agents,
   and then calls :meth:`TestsuiteRunner.run`.
